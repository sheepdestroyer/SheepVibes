URL-validated processing and weighted SSE progress reporting, wires the blueprint to that service, adds SSE-driven progress UI for OPML import and feed refresh, tightens URL validation throughout feed processing, and extends tests (including SSE and Playwright coverage) to match the new behavior.\n\n### File-Level Changes\n\n| Change | Details | Files |\n| ------ | ------- | ----- |\n| Refactor OPML import into backend/feed_service with iterative processing, URL validation, weighted progress, cache invalidation, and tab management. | <ul><li>Introduce import_opml service that reads the OPML stream once, parses it with defusedxml, and coordinates the full import flow.</li><li>Replace recursive outline traversal with _process_opml_outlines_iterative using an explicit stack to avoid RecursionError and support progress tracking.</li><li>Add URL validation helpers (validate_link_structure, is_valid_feed_url) to enforce http/https schemes and reject malformed URLs during import.</li><li>Implement _determine_target_tab, _cleanup_empty_default_tab, and _invalidate_import_caches to select or create target tabs, remove unused default tabs, and bulk-invalidate caches for affected tabs.</li><li>Batch-commit new feeds and perform initial fetches with _batch_commit_and_fetch_new_feeds, emitting weighted SSE progress events for the fetching phase.</li><li>Count feeds up front via _count_feeds_in_opml and compute a 50/50 processing vs fetching progress scale exposed over SSE via announcer.</li></ul> | `backend/feed_service.py`<br/>`backend/constants.py` |\n| Simplify the OPML blueprint into a thin HTTP wrapper around the new service and clean up OPML export and autosave helpers. | <ul><li>Remove in-blueprint recursive import logic, tab-selection, cache invalidation, and fetch-on-import responsibilities, delegating them to feed_service.import_opml.</li><li>Adjust import_opml route to validate the uploaded file, extract tab_id, call the service, and translate its (result, error) tuple into JSON HTTP responses.</li><li>Keep and slightly tidy OPML export and autosave helpers, including more explicit exception handling and logging during export generation.</li></ul> | `backend/blueprints/opml.py` |\n| Add SSE-driven progress reporting for bulk feed refresh and ensure reliable completion signaling. | <ul><li>Extend update_all_feeds to announce an initial progress event, per-feed progress updates keyed by processed feed count, and a final progress_complete event over SSE.</li><li>Track successful_count, total_feeds, and affected_tab_ids while processing futures, and update logging to reflect successful vs total feeds.</li><li>Standardize error logging in feed processing to use sqlalchemy.exc.SQLAlchemyError where appropriate and logger.exception for richer tracebacks.</li></ul> | `backend/feed_service.py`<br/>`backend/test_app.py` |\n| Harden URL handling in feed metadata and item processing to avoid unsafe or malformed links. | <ul><li>Use validate_link_structure when updating a feed's site_link, logging and discarding potentially unsafe links instead of storing them.</li><li>Apply validate_link_structure to entry links in _collect_new_items so items with missing or invalid links are skipped with warnings.</li><li>Adjust tests that exercise feed processing and item creation to cover the new URL validation behavior and time-handling paths.</li></ul> | `backend/feed_service.py`<br/>`backend/test_app.py` |\n| Introduce a sticky progress bar UI and SSE handling on the frontend for OPML import and bulk feed refresh operations. | <ul><li>Add a sticky progress container with status text and HTML <progress> bar in index.html and style it in style.css to remain visible below the header.</li><li>Expose showProgress, updateProgress, and hideProgress helpers in ui.js to manipulate the progress UI.</li><li>Wire app.js to show progress and start a fallback timeout when triggering OPML import or refresh-all, update the bar from SSE progress events, and hide it on progress_complete or error.</li><li>Normalize handling of affected_tab_ids from SSE events by converting them to numbers, invalidating loadedTabs, refetching tabs metadata, and reloading affected active tabs.</li><li>Implement a progress fallback timer in app.js that hides the progress bar if SSE events stall, preventing the UI from getting stuck.</li><li>Update tests to assert the new SSE contract and frontend behavior, including a Playwright test (marked flaky/skip) that validates end-to-end progress UI for import and refresh.</li></ul> | `frontend/index.html`<br/>`frontend/js/ui.js`<br/>`frontend/js/app.js`<br/>`frontend/style.css`<br/>`backend/test_app.py`<br/>`test_progress.py` |\n| Update and align tests and documentation with the new OPML import and progress behavior. | <ul><li>Switch OPML-import-related patches from backend.blueprints.opml.fetch_and_update_feed to backend.feed_service.fetch_and_update_feed to match the refactor.</li><li>Adjust multiple backend tests to account for new return values, SSE event payloads, and minor signature or logging changes in update_all_feeds and import_opml.</li><li>Add test_opml_import and test_progress coverage for OPML import behavior and SSE progress, while skipping the flaky Playwright test in CI.</li><li>Document the feature in CHANGELOG and clarify TODO entry for OPML import/export robustness and security.</li></ul> | `backend/test_app.py`<br/>`test_opml_import.py`<br/>`test_progress.py`<br/>`CHANGELOG.md`<br/>`TODO.md` |\n\n### Assessment against linked issues\n\n| Issue | Objective | Addressed | Explanation |\n|

Consider adding a fallback (e.g., timeout or non-SSE success path that calls `hideProgress`) so the UI doesn\u2019t get stuck in a perpetual busy state when SSE events don\u2019t arrive.\n\nSuggested implementation:\n\n```javascript\n    hideProgress\n} from './ui.js';\n\nconst PROGRESS_FALLBACK_TIMEOUT_MS = 15000;\n\n// State\n\n```\n\n```javascript\nasync function handleRefreshAllFeeds() {\n    showProgress('Starting feed refresh...');\n    let progressFallbackTimeoutId;\n    try {\n        await api.updateAllFeeds();\n        // The SSE events will drive the rest of the UI updates.\n        // Fallback: hide the progress bar if SSE events never arrive.\n        progressFallbackTimeoutId = setTimeout(() => {\n            hideProgress();\n        }, PROGRESS_FALLBACK_TIMEOUT_MS);\n    } catch (e) {\n        showToast('Failed to refresh: ' + e.message, 'error');\n        hideProgress(); // Hide progress bar on failure\n        if (progressFallbackTimeoutId) {\n            clearTimeout(progressFallbackTimeoutId);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n```javascript\n    formData.append('file', file);\n    if (activeTabId !== null) formData.append('tab_id', activeTabId);\n\n    showProgress('Importing OPML file...');\n    let progressFallbackTimeoutId;\n    try {\n        const data = await api.importOpml(formData);\n\n        // Fallback: hide the progress bar if SSE events never arrive.\n        progressFallbackTimeoutId = setTimeout(() => {\n            hideProgress();\n        }, PROGRESS_FALLBACK_TIMEOUT_MS);\n\n```\n\n1. If you have a centralized SSE handler where `progress_complete` leads to `hideProgress()`, consider clearing any outstanding fallback timeout there. That would require:\n   - Storing the timeout IDs (`progressFallbackTimeoutId`) in a broader scope (module-level or state object) instead of as local variables.\n   - When handling `progress_complete` SSE events, calling `clearTimeout` on any stored timeout IDs before/after `hideProgress()`.\n\n2. Ensure the OPML import handler\u2019s `catch`/`finally` block (not shown in the snippet) calls `hideProgress()` on failure and clears `progressFallbackTimeoutId` similarly to `handleRefreshAllFeeds`, so the timeout doesn\u2019t fire after an error.\n\n\u2705 Addressed in 3c50a1f6448fbd5241d8273cd7ea4fc9037f2a06: A module-level fallback timeout and helper functions (_startProgressFallback/_clearProgressFallback) were added so both refresh and OPML import clear or hide the progress bar if SSE events don\u2019t arrive or on failure.",

The test assumes `app`, `client`, and `user` fixtures are already defined in `backend/test_app.py` (or conftest).  \n   - If your user fixture is named differently (e.g. `test_user`), update the test signature and the `user=` argument accordingly.\n\n2. **Align with the actual `import_opml` signature**  \n   - The call to `import_opml(...)` uses keyword arguments: `user`, `opml_content`, `tab_id`, `client_uuid`, `fetch_items`.  \n   - Update the parameter names and ordering to match your real `backend.feed_service.import_opml` function (e.g. if it expects `user_id` instead of `user`, or `sse_client_id` instead of `client_uuid`, or does not support `tab_id`).\n\n3. **Match the announcer API**  \n   - The test assumes `announcer.announce(channel, event_dict)` or a kwargs-based equivalent.  \n   - If your actual announcer has a different signature (e.g. `announce(event_dict)` with the channel embedded, or uses `event` / `data` / `message` keys differently), adjust the extraction of `channel` and `event` from `call.args` / `call.kwargs` so that `announced_events` captures the right payloads for this import stream.\n\n4. **Align summary format**  \n   - The test asserts `summary.get(\"status\")` and compares it with `final_event.get(\"status\")`.  \n   - If `import_opml` returns a different structure (e.g. `{\"ok\": True, ...}` or nested `{\"summary\": {\"status\": ...}}`), update the `summary` access and the final assertion to use the appropriate fields.\n\n5. **Optional: tighten expectations**  \n   - If `import_opml` guarantees that the final `progress_complete` event has `progress == 100`, you can extend the test to assert that explicitly.  \n   - You can also assert the weighted 50/50 behavior more strongly by checking that early progress events do not immediately jump to 100, depending on how stable you want the test to be relative to internal implementation details.\n\n\u2705 Addressed in 3c50a1f6448fbd5241d8273cd7ea4fc9037f2a06: The OPML import logic has been moved to backend.feed_service.import_opml, and new dedicated tests (test_opml_import.py/test_progress.py) have been introduced to cover import behavior and progress events at the unit level.",

If your SSE message format differs (for example, no `\"data: \"` prefix or different JSON keys like `\"current\"`/`\"total\"` instead of `\"value\"`/`\"max\"`), update `_extract_payload` and the assertions on `progress_events[0]` to match the actual structure.\n4. If `import_opml` has a different signature (e.g., additional parameters, no `user=` keyword, or returns a different result shape), adapt the call to `feed_service.import_opml(...)` and the `result[\"message\"]` assertion to the real interface.",

If an OPML file has many folders or other non-feed outlines, `processed_count` can exceed `total_feeds_to_import`, causing the progress value to go beyond its intended maximum for the processing phase and making the status message confusing (e.g., \"Processing feed 15/10...\").\n\nI suggest two changes:\n1.

When `db.session.flush()` fails with an `IntegrityError` (e.g., two processes try to create the same tab folder simultaneously), `db.session.rollback()` is called. This rollback reverts the entire transaction, which includes any `Feed` objects that were added to the session via `_process_opml_feed_node` but not yet committed.\n\nThese feed objects, while still present in the `newly_added_feeds_list`, become detached from the session and will not be committed later. This results in silent data loss for the feeds that were being processed before this race condition occurred.\n\nA way to address this is to use nested transactions (savepoints) to isolate the tab creation attempt. This would allow you to roll back just the failed `flush` without discarding the entire session's state.\n\nHere's a conceptual example:\n```python\ndb.session.add(new_folder_tab)\ns = db.session.begin_nested()\ntry:\n    db.session.flush()\nexcept sqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError:\n    s.rollback() # Roll back only the savepoint\n    # The main session is still active. Now fetch the tab created by the other process.\n    existing_tab = Tab.query.filter_by(name=folder_name).first()\n    if existing_tab:\n        return existing_tab.id, existing_tab.name\n    # This path would be highly unusual.\n    raise\n\n# If flush succeeds, the nested transaction will be part of the main transaction.\nreturn new_folder_tab.id, new_folder_tab.name\n```\nThis approach ensures that a race condition on tab creation doesn't cause data loss for already processed feeds.",

This process involves making multiple external network requests to fetch and update feeds (via `import_opml_service`). Since these requests are performed sequentially and can take a significant amount of time (especially with a 10-second timeout per fetch), an attacker can upload an OPML file with many feeds to tie up a Flask worker for an extended period. This can lead to worker exhaustion and a denial of service for the entire application. \n\n**Recommendation:** Move the feed fetching and processing logic to a background task (e.g., using a task queue like Celery or a separate background thread) and return a response to the user immediately.

If the SSE connection fails, is blocked, or the tab isn\u2019t connected when the event is sent, the progress bar will remain visible. Consider adding a fallback (e.g., timeout or non-SSE success path that calls `hideProgress`) so the UI doesn\u2019t get stuck in a perpetual busy state when SSE events don\u2019t arrive.\n\nSuggested implementation:\n\n```javascript\n    hideProgress\n} from './ui.js';\n\nconst PROGRESS_FALLBACK_TIMEOUT_MS = 15000;\n\n// State\n\n```\n\n```javascript\nasync function handleRefreshAllFeeds() {\n    showProgress('Starting feed refresh...');\n    let progressFallbackTimeoutId;\n    try {\n        await api.updateAllFeeds();\n        // The SSE events will drive the rest of the UI updates.\n        // Fallback: hide the progress bar if SSE events never arrive.\n        progressFallbackTimeoutId = setTimeout(() => {\n            hideProgress();\n        }, PROGRESS_FALLBACK_TIMEOUT_MS);\n    } catch (e) {\n        showToast('Failed to refresh: ' + e.message, 'error');\n        hideProgress(); // Hide progress bar on failure\n        if (progressFallbackTimeoutId) {\n            clearTimeout(progressFallbackTimeoutId);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n```javascript\n    formData.append('file', file);\n    if (activeTabId !== null) formData.append('tab_id', activeTabId);\n\n    showProgress('Importing OPML file...');\n    let progressFallbackTimeoutId;\n    try {\n        const data = await api.importOpml(formData);\n\n        // Fallback: hide the progress bar if SSE events never arrive.\n        progressFallbackTimeoutId = setTimeout(() => {\n            hideProgress();\n        }, PROGRESS_FALLBACK_TIMEOUT_MS);\n\n```\n\n1. If you have a centralized SSE handler where `progress_complete` leads to `hideProgress()`, consider clearing any outstanding fallback timeout there. That would require:\n   - Storing the timeout IDs (`progressFallbackTimeoutId`) in a broader scope (module-level or state object) instead of as local variables.\n   - When handling `progress_complete` SSE events, calling `clearTimeout` on any stored timeout IDs before/after `hideProgress()`.\n\n2. Ensure the OPML import handler\u2019s `catch`/`finally` block (not shown in the snippet) calls `hideProgress()` on failure and clears `progressFallbackTimeoutId` similarly to `handleRefreshAllFeeds`, so the timeout doesn\u2019t fire after an error.\n</issue_to_address>\n\n### Comment 5\n<location> `backend/test_app.py:1443` </location>\n<code_context>\n\n\n-@patch(\"backend.blueprints.opml.fetch_and_update_feed\")\n+@patch(\"backend.feed_service.fetch_and_update_feed\")\n def test_import_opml_success(mock_fetch_update, client):\n     \"\"\"Test POST /api/opml/import with a valid OPML file and item fetching.\"\"\"\n</code_context>\n\n<issue_to_address>\n**suggestion (testing):** Add an OPML import test to assert non-http/https `xmlUrl` entries are rejected and counted as skipped\n\nSince `is_valid_feed_url` now restricts `xmlUrl` schemes as an XSS mitigation, it would be good to cover that behavior here. Please extend the OPML import tests with a case that mixes invalid schemes (`javascript:`, `data:`, `ftp:`) and valid http/https feeds, and assert that:\n\n- No `Feed` rows are created for the invalid schemes,\n- `skipped_count` matches the number of rejected entries, and\n- The response message and `affected_tab_ids` still reflect a successful import of the valid feeds.\n\nThis keeps the security behavior under test and prevents regressions.\n\nSuggested implementation:\n\n```python\n# OPML import should reject non-http/https xmlUrl entries while importing valid ones.\n@patch(\"backend.feed_service.fetch_and_update_feed\")\ndef test_import_opml_rejects_non_http_schemes(mock_fetch_update, client):\n    \"\"\"OPML import: non-http/https xmlUrl entries are rejected and counted as skipped.\"\"\"\n    # Prepare an OPML file with mixed valid/invalid schemes\n    opml_content = \"\"\"<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<opml version=\"2.0\">\n  <body>\n    <outline text=\"Valid HTTP Feed\" xmlUrl=\"http://example.com/feed1.xml\" />\n    <outline text=\"Valid HTTPS Feed\" xmlUrl=\"https://example.com/feed2.xml\" />\n    <outline text=\"JS Feed\" xmlUrl=\"javascript:alert('xss')\" />\n    <outline text=\"Data Feed\" xmlUrl=\"data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgxKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg==\" />\n    <outline text=\"FTP Feed\" xmlUrl=\"ftp://example.com/feed3.xml\" />\n  </body>\n</opml>\n\"\"\"\n    # Use an in-memory file for the upload\n    # NOTE: ensure `import io` is present at the top of this module.\n    file_storage = (io.BytesIO(opml_content.encode(\"utf-8\")), \"mixed_schemes.opml\")\n\n    # Act\n    response = client.post(\n        \"/api/opml/import\",\n        data={\n            \"file\": file_storage,\n            # If your endpoint requires a tab_id, use an appropriate value/fixture\n            # \"tab_id\": str(tab_id),\n        },\n        content_type=\"multipart/form-data\",\n    )\n\n    # Assert basic request success\n    assert response.status_code == 200\n    data = response.get_json()\n\n    # We have 3 invalid schemes: javascript:, data:, ftp:\n    assert data[\"skipped_count\"] == 3\n\n    # Depending on your implementation, you may expose an imported_count or similar;\n    # adjust as needed to assert that only the 2 valid feeds were imported.\n    if \"imported_count\" in data:\n        assert data[\"imported_count\"] == 2\n\n    # Response should still reflect a successful import message\n    # (adapt the substring to your actual message wording).\n    assert \"Imported\" in data[\"message\"]\n    assert \"feed\" in data[\"message\"].lower()\n\n    # affected_tab_ids should reflect that import affected at least one tab\n    assert \"affected_tab_ids\" in data\n    assert isinstance(data[\"affected_tab_ids\"], list)\n\n# --- Tests for OPML Import (/api/opml/import) ---\n\n```\n\n1. Ensure `import io` is present at the top of `backend/test_app.py`, alongside the other imports.\n2. If `/api/opml/import` requires a `tab_id`, update the test to:\n   - Accept any existing `tab_id` fixture used elsewhere (e.g. add it as a parameter: `def test_import_opml_rejects_non_http_schemes(..., tab_id):`).\n   - Include `\"tab_id\": str(tab_id)` in the `data` dict for the POST request.\n   - Strengthen the assertion on `affected_tab_ids`, e.g. `assert data[\"affected_tab_ids\"] == [tab_id]` if that matches your API behavior.\n3. If your response JSON uses different keys than `skipped_count`, `imported_count`, or `message`, adjust the dictionary accesses and assertions to those actual keys.\n4. If you want to assert at the database level that no `Feed` rows were created for invalid schemes, add the appropriate fixture (e.g. `db_session`) to the test signature and assert against your `Feed` model, for example:\n   - `assert Feed.query.filter(Feed.feed_url.startswith(\"javascript:\")).count() == 0`,\n   - similarly for `data:` and `ftp:` URLs,\n   - and that the total number of created `Feed` rows matches the number of valid entries (2 in this test).\n</issue_to_address>\n\n### Comment 6\n<location> `backend/test_app.py:746` </location>\n<code_context>\n\n @patch(\"backend.blueprints.feeds.announcer.announce\")\n @patch(\"backend.blueprints.feeds.update_all_feeds\")\n-def test_update_all_feeds_success(mock_update_all_feeds, mock_announce, client):\n</code_context>\n\n<issue_to_address>\n**suggestion (testing):** Consider adding a unit test for `feed_service.update_all_feeds` to assert the new SSE progress events\n\nThe new implementation emits `progress` and `progress_complete` events via `announcer.announce`, but the current tests only cover `/api/feeds/update-all` at the blueprint level and don\u2019t verify these semantics.\n\nA focused unit test for `feed_service.update_all_feeds` could:\n- Patch `Feed.query.all` to return a small list of feeds.\n- Patch `_fetch_feed_content` / `_process_fetch_result` to avoid network/DB side effects.\n- Patch `feed_service.announcer.announce` to capture calls.\n\nThen assert that:\n- An initial `progress` event is sent with `value: 0` and `max` equal to the feed count.\n- Per-feed `progress` events are emitted as feeds are processed.\n- A final `progress_complete` event is emitted at the end.\n\nThis would directly test the new progress event behavior that endpoint-level tests don\u2019t currently cover.\n\nSuggested implementation:\n\n```python\n    assert response.status_code == 200\n    assert (response.content_type == \"text/html; charset=utf-8\"\n            )  # Flask default for send_from_directory\n    assert b\"<title>SheepVibes</title>\" in response.data\n\n\n@patch(\"backend.services.feed_service.announcer.announce\")\n@patch(\"backend.services.feed_service._process_fetch_result\")\n@patch(\"backend.services.feed_service._fetch_feed_content\")\n@patch(\"backend.services.feed_service.Feed\")\ndef test_feed_service_update_all_feeds_emits_progress_events(\n    mock_feed_model, mock_fetch_feed_content, mock_process_fetch_result, mock_announce\n):\n    \"\"\"Unit test for feed_service.update_all_feeds SSE progress events.\"\"\"\n    from unittest.mock import MagicMock\n    from backend.services import feed_service\n\n    # Arrange: mock Feed.query.all to return a small list of feeds\n    feeds = [MagicMock(id=1), MagicMock(id=2), MagicMock(id=3)]\n    mock_feed_model.query.all.return_value = feeds\n\n    # Avoid side effects from fetch/process\n    mock_fetch_feed_content.return_value = \"dummy-content\"\n    mock_process_fetch_result.return_value = None\n\n    # Act\n    feed_service.update_all_feeds()\n\n    # Assert\n    calls = mock_announce.call_args_list\n    # Extract event names and payloads from announce(event_name, payload)\n    event_names = [call.args[0] for call in calls]\n    payloads = [call.args[1] for call in calls]\n\n    # Initial progress event\n    assert event_names[0] == \"progress\"\n    assert payloads[0][\"value\"] == 0\n    assert payloads[0][\"max\"] == len(feeds)\n\n    # Per-feed progress events\n    per_feed_payloads = payloads[1 : 1 + len(feeds)]\n    assert len(per_feed_payloads) == len(feeds)\n    for index, payload in enumerate(per_feed_payloads, start=1):\n        assert payload[\"value\"] == index\n        assert payload[\"max\"] == len(feeds)\n\n    # Final progress_complete event\n    assert event_names[-1] == \"progress_complete\"\n\n@patch(\"backend.blueprints.feeds.announcer.announce\")\n@patch(\"backend.blueprints.feeds.update_all_feeds\")\ndef test_update_all_feeds_success(mock_update_all_feeds, mock_announce,\n                                  client):\n\n```\n\n- Ensure the actual import path to `feed_service`, `Feed`, `_fetch_feed_content`, `_process_fetch_result`, and `announcer.announce` in your code matches the strings used in the `@patch` decorators (`backend.services.feed_service.*`).

It also includes security hardening on URL validation. A security audit covering `backend/blueprints/opml.py`, `backend/feed_service.py`, `frontend/js/app.js`, `frontend/js/ui.js`, `frontend/index.html`, `backend/constants.py`, and `frontend/style.css` found no vulnerabilities. The code is well-structured, especially the refactoring of import logic into `feed_service`. Minor suggestions for improvement include clarifying a confusing constant redefinition and addressing the use of broad exception handlers.",

The test assumes `app`, `client`, and `user` fixtures are already defined in `backend/test_app.py` (or conftest).  \n   - If your user fixture is named differently (e.g. `test_user`), update the test signature and the `user=` argument accordingly.\n\n2. **Align with the actual `import_opml` signature**  \n   - The call to `import_opml(...)` uses keyword arguments: `user`, `opml_content`, `tab_id`, `client_uuid`, `fetch_items`.  \n   - Update the parameter names and ordering to match your real `backend.feed_service.import_opml` function (e.g. if it expects `user_id` instead of `user`, or `sse_client_id` instead of `client_uuid`, or does not support `tab_id`).\n\n3. **Match the announcer API**  \n   - The test assumes `announcer.announce(channel, event_dict)` or a kwargs-based equivalent.  \n   - If your actual announcer has a different signature (e.g. `announce(event_dict)` with the channel embedded, or uses `event` / `data` / `message` keys differently), adjust the extraction of `channel` and `event` from `call.args` / `call.kwargs` so that `announced_events` captures the right payloads for this import stream.\n\n4. **Align summary format**  \n   - The test asserts `summary.get(\"status\")` and compares it with `final_event.get(\"status\")`.  \n   - If `import_opml` returns a different structure (e.g. `{\"ok\": True, ...}` or nested `{\"summary\": {\"status\": ...}}`), update the `summary` access and the final assertion to use the appropriate fields.\n\n5. **Optional: tighten expectations**  \n   - If `import_opml` guarantees that the final `progress_complete` event has `progress == 100`, you can extend the test to assert that explicitly.  \n   - You can also assert the weighted 50/50 behavior more strongly by checking that early progress events do not immediately jump to 100, depending on how stable you want the test to be relative to internal implementation details.\n</issue_to_address>\n\n### Comment 3\n<location> `test_progress.py:10` </location>\n<code_context>\n+@pytest.mark.skip(\n+    reason=\"Flaky in CI due to SSE timing issues; backend logic verified\")\n</code_context>\n\n<issue_to_address>\n**suggestion (testing):** Revisit permanently skipped Playwright progress test or provide an alternative non-flaky check.\n\nWith this Playwright test fully skipped, CI never exercises the progress/status UI, even though it\u2019s central to this change. Please either (1) deflake and re-enable the test (e.g. by synchronizing on specific DOM states or more deterministic signals), (2) mark it `xfail` under a clear condition instead of `skip`, or (3) add at least one lighter-weight automated frontend test (unit test of the progress helpers or a simpler Playwright flow) so the progress UI isn\u2019t only verified manually.\n</issue_to_address>\n~~~\n\n</details>\n\n***\n\nHi @sheepdestroyer! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nThanks for trying out Sourcery by commenting with `@sourcery-ai review`! \ud83d\ude80\n\nInstall the [sourcery-ai bot](https://github.com/apps/sourcery-ai/installations/new) to get automatic code reviews on every pull request \u2728\n\n<sub>\nHelp me be more useful!

The decorator target `\"backend.feed_service.fetch_and_update_feed\"` must match the actual import path used inside `feed_service.import_opml`. If the function is imported or referenced under a different name/path (e.g., `_fetch_and_update_feed` or from another module), adjust the `@patch(...)` target accordingly.\n3. If your SSE message format differs (for example, no `\"data: \"` prefix or different JSON keys like `\"current\"`/`\"total\"` instead of `\"value\"`/`\"max\"`), update `_extract_payload` and the assertions on `progress_events[0]` to match the actual structure.\n4. If `import_opml` has a different signature (e.g., additional parameters, no `user=` keyword, or returns a different result shape), adapt the call to `feed_service.import_opml(...)` and the `result[\"message\"]` assertion to the real interface.\n</issue_to_address>\n~~~\n\n</details>\n\n***\n\n<details>\n<summary>Sourcery is free for open source - if you like our reviews please consider sharing them \u2728</summary>\n\n- [X](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%20just%20got%20an%20instant%20code%20review%20from%20%40SourceryAI%2C%20and%20it%20was%20brilliant%21%20It%27s%20free%20for%20open%20source%20and%20has%20a%20free%20trial%20for%20private%20code.%20Check%20it%20out%20https%3A//sourcery.ai)\n- [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/share?text=I%20just%20got%20an%20instant%20code%20review%20from%20%40SourceryAI%2C%20and%20it%20was%20brilliant%21%20It%27s%20free%20for%20open%20source%20and%20has%20a%20free%20trial%20for%20private%20code.%20Check%20it%20out%20https%3A//sourcery.ai)\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https://sourcery.ai)\n- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://sourcery.ai)\n\n</details>\n\n<sub>\nHelp me be more useful!

Key changes include migrating the OPML parsing to a stack-based iterative approach in `backend/feed_service.py` to prevent recursion depth issues, and implementing a weighted, continuous progress bar for both OPML imports and feed refreshes using Server-Sent Events (SSE). Security is improved by hardening `xmlUrl` validation to allow only `http` and `https` schemes, and by sanitizing URLs for logging to prevent XSS. The OPML import logic, along with related helper functions for tab management and feed processing, has been moved from `backend/blueprints/opml.py` to `backend/feed_service.py` for better modularity. Error handling across the `feed_service` has been refined by replacing broad `Exception` catches with `sqlalchemy.exc.SQLAlchemyError` and using `logger.exception` for automatic stack trace inclusion. The frontend (`frontend/index.html`, `frontend/js/app.js`, `frontend/js/ui.js`, `frontend/style.css`) has been updated to display the new progress bar and handle SSE events for real-time updates during these operations, including a fallback mechanism for progress display. Additionally, new `SKIPPED_FOLDER_TYPES` have been defined in `backend/constants.py` for more comprehensive OPML folder skipping, and various test files (`backend/test_app.py`, `test_opml_import.py`, `test_progress.py`) have been updated to reflect these changes, including new tests for progress events and URL validation.",

The code is well-structured, moving business logic into a dedicated service layer, which greatly improves maintainability. The addition of weighted progress reporting via Server-Sent Events (SSE) and a corresponding UI progress bar provides a much better user experience for long-running tasks. Security has also been enhanced by hardening URL validation to prevent potential XSS attacks. The changes are well-tested, including new unit tests for SSE progress events and an end-to-end test. I have one minor suggestion for improving logging consistency, but overall this is an excellent contribution.",

The changes enhance security by validating URLs and improve the overall architecture by moving logic to a service layer. The frontend updates to display progress are well-implemented, including a fallback timeout for reliability. I've found a couple of minor issues: one misleading comment in the new service logic and a slightly inaccurate mock in a test case. Overall, this is a very solid contribution.",

The code is also well-structured, moving business logic to a dedicated service layer. However, a critical security concern is that the implementation of these processes is synchronous and blocking within the `Flask` request-response cycle, posing a high risk of Denial of Service (`DoS`) via worker exhaustion, and the lack of concurrency control for the refresh process can lead to resource exhaustion. Additionally, clarification is requested regarding a subtle change in behavior when handling skipped folder types during `OPML` import that could lead to unintended imports.",
