    "body": "## Code Review\n\nThis pull request introduces a new, unified PR review tracking system, which is a great improvement over the previous method of closing and reopening pull requests. The new `check-review-status.sh` script is well-structured with good features like polling, rate limit handling, and file locking. The documentation is comprehensive. I've identified a few areas for improvement, mainly concerning inconsistencies between the documentation and the script's implementation, as well as some opportunities to make the script more robust. Key issues include outdated instructions in the microagent documentation, a discrepancy in the tracking file implementation versus its design, and a potentially overly broad filter for detecting review comments.",

    "body": "## Code Review\n\nThis pull request introduces a new, unified PR review tracking system, which is a significant improvement over the previous separate microagents. The new `check-review-status.sh` script is well-structured and includes essential features like polling, rate limit handling with exponential backoff, and file locking for safe concurrent operations. The accompanying documentation in `pr-review-tracker.md` and `PR_REVIEW_TRACKER_README.md` is thorough and helpful for understanding the new workflow.\n\nMy review focuses on further enhancing the new bash script's robustness, efficiency, and maintainability. I've suggested improvements to the GitHub API interaction logic, making it more efficient and resilient. I've also provided feedback on making the script more portable by dynamically detecting repository information and refining the logic for identifying review comments to avoid potential false positives. Additionally, there's a minor suggestion to clarify the documentation regarding concurrent script execution.",
