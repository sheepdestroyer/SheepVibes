    "body": "## Summary of Changes\n\nHello @sheepdestroyer, I'm Gemini Code Assist[^1]! I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!\n\nThis pull request introduces a significant overhaul to the Pull Request review process, particularly for interactions with Google Code Assist. It consolidates previous, disparate microagents into a single, more robust `pr-review-tracker` system. The core change is a shift from an inefficient 'close and reopen PR' cycle to a streamlined workflow that leverages a manual `/gemini review` trigger, complemented by an enhanced script for monitoring review status, global state tracking, and comprehensive documentation. These changes aim to improve the efficiency, clarity, and reliability of code review cycles.\n\n### Highlights\n\n* **Unified Microagent**: Replaced the separate `code-review-cycle.md` and `pr-ready-review.md` microagents with a single, comprehensive `pr-review-tracker.md` microagent for managing PR reviews.\n* **Enhanced Review Script**: Introduced `check-review-status.sh`, a new bash script for monitoring Google Code Assist review status. This script includes features like polling for comments, robust rate limit handling with exponential backoff, and extraction of comments to JSON files.\n* **Global State Tracking**: Implemented `pr-review-tracker.json` as a global tracking file to maintain the state of all working branches, including associated PR numbers, current review status, and individual comment tracking.\n* **Simplified Review Workflow**: Transitioned from a workflow that required closing and reopening PRs to trigger new reviews. The new system uses a more efficient manual trigger (`/gemini review` comment) for re-reviews after pushing changes.\n* **Comprehensive Documentation**: Added `PR_REVIEW_TRACKER_README.md` to provide detailed documentation and usage examples for the new PR Review Tracker system, including migration guidance from the previous setup.\n* **Robustness Improvements**: Incorporated file locking mechanisms for the `pr-review-tracker.json` file to prevent concurrent access issues and added error recovery strategies for corrupted tracking files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Using Gemini Code Assist</b></summary>\n<br>\n\nThe full guide for Gemini Code Assist can be found on our [documentation page](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/review-github-code), here are some quick tips.\n\n<b>Invoking Gemini</b>\n\nYou can request assistance from Gemini at any point by creating a comment using either `/gemini <command>` or `@gemini-code-assist <command>`.
