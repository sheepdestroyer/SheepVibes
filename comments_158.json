  "body": "## Code Review\n\nThis pull request introduces a new, unified microagent and associated tooling for tracking PR reviews, which is a significant improvement that simplifies the previous workflow. The changes are well-documented and the new scripts are robust, with features like polling and rate-limit handling. However, my review identified a critical security vulnerability due to a hardcoded API key in a configuration file. I also found several high-severity bugs in the `check-review-status.sh` script that could lead to crashes or incorrect behavior, along with some medium-severity issues related to documentation clarity and code duplication. I've provided detailed comments and suggestions to address these points. Once these issues are resolved, this will be an excellent contribution.",
