  "body": "## Code Review\n\nThis pull request introduces a new, unified system for tracking PR reviews, which is a great improvement. It replaces older microagents and adds powerful scripts for automation. However, there are several issues to address. Most critically, a hardcoded API key has been committed in `.openhands/settings.json`. There are also some bugs in the new shell scripts, such as a copy-paste error and logic issues in comment extraction. Additionally, several generated files and test files have been committed that should be git-ignored or removed. I've provided detailed comments and suggestions to fix these issues.",
