  "body": "## Code Review\n\nThis pull request introduces a new, unified system for tracking PR reviews, which is a great improvement over the previous workflow. The new scripts for checking status and triggering reviews are well-featured, with rate limit handling and polling. The documentation is comprehensive. However, there are a few critical and high-severity issues that need to be addressed. Most importantly, a hardcoded API key has been committed, which is a major security risk. There's also a significant bug in `check-review-status.sh` due to a copy-paste error, and another bug in how it processes review comments. I've also noted some inconsistencies in the documentation and minor bugs in the scripts.",
