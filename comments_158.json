  "body": "## Code Review\n\nThis pull request introduces a new, unified microagent for tracking PR reviews, which simplifies the previous workflow. The changes include new documentation and scripts for managing the review process. However, there are critical security issues that must be addressed. A hardcoded JWT secret has been added in `.openhands/.jwt_secret`, and numerous session files containing potentially sensitive data have been committed under `.openhands/sessions/`. These files must be removed from the repository's history, and the `.gitignore` file should be updated to prevent this from happening again. Additionally, there's a minor structural issue in the new `pr-review-tracker.md` documentation that makes the workflow section slightly confusing. I've provided specific comments with suggestions to resolve these issues. The security vulnerabilities are critical and must be fixed before this PR can be considered for merging.",
