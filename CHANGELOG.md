- **Fix(feed_service): Use entry link as GUID to prevent UNIQUE constraint errors**
  - The MIT Technology Review feed was failing to update because it was providing the same GUID for multiple different articles. This was causing a UNIQUE constraint failure in the database.
  - This change modifies the `feed_service` to always use the entry's link as the GUID. The link is a reliable and unique identifier for each article, which will prevent this issue from happening in the future.
