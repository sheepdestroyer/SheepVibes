## 2026-01-26 - Optimized to_dict serialization
**Learning:** `Feed.to_dict()` triggered a separate SQL query for unread counts, causing N+1 issues when serializing lists of feeds.
**Action:** Always pre-calculate aggregate data (like counts) in the main route handler and pass it to `to_dict` to keep serialization O(1).

## 2026-02-10 - Avoid COUNT(*) for limit enforcement
**Learning:** When enforcing a limit on a collection (e.g., "keep top N items"), counting the collection first is redundant. Instead, query for items *beyond* the offset N directly.
**Action:** Use `order_by(DESC).offset(N).all()` to find items to evict in a single step.
