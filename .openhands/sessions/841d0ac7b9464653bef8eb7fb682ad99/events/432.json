Waits for code reviews from Google Code Assist and other agents\n2. Addresses all review comments\n3. Closes the current PR\n4. Opens a new PR to trigger fresh reviews\n\n## Core Rules\n\n1. **Wait for reviews**: After creating a PR and marking it ready to review, wait 5 minutes for Google Code Assist and other agents to provide feedback\n2. **Retry if no comments**: If no comments are received after 5 minutes, wait 5 more minutes and try one last time\n3. **Address all comments**: Thoroughly review and implement all feedback from code reviews\n4. **Close and reopen**: Close the current PR and open a new one to trigger fresh reviews\n5. **Maximum 10 cycles**: Repeat the cycle for a maximum of 10 iterations\n\n## Workflow\n\n### Initial Setup:\n1. Create a new branch with a meaningful name that describes the changes\n2. Ensure the branch name is unique to avoid conflicts\n\n### Code Review Cycle (Repeat up to 10 times):\n1. **Create PR**: Open a pull request with clear title and description\n2. **Mark ready**: Immediately mark the PR as ready to review (not draft)\n3. **Wait for reviews**: \n   - Wait 5 minutes for Google Code Assist and other agents to provide feedback\n   - If no comments received, wait 5 more minutes and check one last time\n4. **Review comments**: Read and analyze all code review comments\n5. **Address feedback**: Implement all requested changes and fixes\n6. **Commit changes**: Commit the fixes to the local branch\n7. **Close PR**: Close the current pull request\n8. **Push changes**: Push the latest changes to the branch\n9. **Open new PR**: Create a new pull request to trigger fresh reviews\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### When Creating Pull Requests:\n1. Use `create_pr` function with `draft: false`\n2. Create meaningful branch names that describe the changes\n3. Follow repository templates if they exist\n4. Apply appropriate labels (e.g., \"enhancement\", \"bug\", \"documentation\")\n5. Include clear descriptions of changes made and purpose\n\n### When Addressing Comments:\n1. Read all comments thoroughly\n2. Implement all requested changes\n3. Verify tests pass after changes\n4. Update documentation (CHANGELOG.md, TODO.md) as needed\n\n## Error Handling\n\n- **Authentication issues**: Update remote URL with current GITHUB_TOKEN\n- **Branch conflicts**: Create new unique branch names\n- **No comments received**: After waiting 10 minutes total, proceed to close and reopen\n- **Maximum cycles reached**: Stop after 10 iterations and report completion\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Example Cycle:\n1. Create branch: `feat/code-review-cycle-agent`\n2. Open PR: \"feat: Add code review cycle microagent\"\n3. Wait 5 minutes for reviews\n4. If comments received, address them\n5. Close current PR\n6. Push changes\n7. Open new PR with updated description\n\n## Configuration\n\n- Use environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` for authentication\n- Default base branch: `main`\n- Always verify PR creation was successful\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- This microagent complements the existing PR Ready to Review and SheepVibes Rules microagents\n- Follow all repository testing requirements and validation workflows, including running the full test suite before each PR creation.\n- Update relevant documentation files upon completion of each cycle"}]}}
