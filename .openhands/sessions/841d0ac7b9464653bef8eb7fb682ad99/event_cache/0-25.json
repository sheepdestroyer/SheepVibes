Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool. Proactive task management demonstrates\nsystematic approach and ensures comprehensive requirement fulfillment.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "enum": ["view", "plan"], "description": "The command to execute. `view` shows the current task list. `plan` creates or updates the task list based on provided requirements and progress.

REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"description": "The commands to run.

Configuration Variables\n- `DATABASE_PATH`: SQLite database file location\n- `UPDATE_INTERVAL_MINUTES`: Feed update frequency (default: 15)\n- `CACHE_REDIS_URL`: Redis connection URL\n- `FLASK_APP`: Path to Flask application (default: backend.app)\n- `FLASK_RUN_HOST`: Flask server host (default: 0.0.0.0)\n- `PYTHONPATH`: Module search path (default: /app in container)\n\n# SheepVibes Repository Rules and Guidelines\n\nThis microagent provides comprehensive knowledge about the SheepVibes RSS/Atom feed aggregator repository, including development workflows, testing requirements, and deployment procedures.\n\n## Core Rules for AI Agents\n\n### Mandatory Workflow Steps\n1. **Read all `.md` files** from the repository before starting any task\n2. **Read both backend & frontend code files** to understand the application's logic\n3. **For each individual step** during a task:\n   - Add new relevant tests to the test suite\n   - Verify pre-existing tests are still valid, correct if necessary\n4. **Execute full CI workflow** as described in `.github/workflows/run-tests.yml`\n5. **Before task completion**:\n   - Run final full validation of all tests\n   - Update relevant `.md` files (especially `TODO.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`)\n\n### Testing Requirements\n- **Backend tests** require a running Redis service container\n- **Dynamic port handling** - Redis port is dynamically mapped in CI environments\n- **Environment variable**: Tests look for `CACHE_REDIS_PORT` to override default Redis port\n- **Full test suite execution** is mandatory before proceeding to next steps\n\n## Application Architecture\n\n### Backend (Python/Flask)\n- **Framework**: Flask with SQLAlchemy ORM\n- **Database**: SQLite with migrations\n- **Caching**: Redis for performance optimization\n- **Background tasks**: APScheduler for automatic feed updates\n- **API**: RESTful endpoints for tabs, feeds, and feed items\n\n### Frontend (Vanilla JavaScript)\n- **No frameworks** - pure JavaScript, HTML, CSS\n- **Real-time updates**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live feed updates\n- **UI**: Netvibes/iGoogle-inspired grid layout\n\n## Development Environment Setup\n\n### Production Deployment (Podman Pod with systemd/Quadlet)\n- Use `scripts/deploy_pod.sh` for stable deployment\n- Pod includes: app container, Redis container, persistent volumes\n- Auto-start configured via systemd user services\n\n### Local Development Options\n1. **Podman containers** with development network\n2. **Direct backend/frontend** development with virtual environment\n\n## Key Configuration Variables\n- `DATABASE_PATH`: SQLite database file location\n- `UPDATE_INTERVAL_MINUTES`: Feed update frequency (default: 15)\n- `CACHE_REDIS_URL`: Redis connection URL\n\n## Testing Procedures\n\n### Backend Testing\n1. Start Redis container: `podman run -d --rm --name sheepvibes-test-redis -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine`\n2. Install dependencies: `cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt`\n3. Run tests: `python -m pytest -v`\n\n### CI/CD Reference\n- **Definitive guide**: `.github/workflows/run-tests.yml`\n- **Service containerization**: Redis service with dynamic port mapping\n- **Environment setup**: Set `CACHE_REDIS_PORT` for dynamic environments\n\n## Error Handling and Limitations\n- **Feed parsing**: Handle timeouts, invalid URLs, bad feed formats\n- **Database constraints**: Use entry link as GUID to prevent UNIQUE constraint errors\n\n## Usage Examples\nWhen working on this repository, agents must:\n- Always start by reading all markdown files\n- Follow the step-by-step validation workflow\n- Replicate CI environment setup for testing\n- Update documentation files upon task completion\n\n## Important Notes\n- The repository follows a strict validation-first approach\n- All changes must be tested and validated before proceeding\n- Documentation updates are part of the completion criteria", "runtime_hosts": {"http://localhost:52004": 52004, "http://localhost:57395": 57395}, "additional_agent_instructions": "", "date": "2025-10-07", "custom_secrets_descriptions": {}, "conversation_instructions": "", "working_dir": "/workspace", "microagent_knowledge": [{"name": "code-review-cycle", "trigger": "review", "content": "# Code Review Cycle Microagent\n\nThis microagent provides guidance for iteratively addressing code reviews through a systematic cycle of review, fix, and re-review.\n\n## Purpose\n\nAutomate the process of addressing code review comments by creating a cycle that:\n1. Waits for code reviews from Google Code Assist and other agents\n2. Addresses all review comments\n3. Closes the current PR\n4. Opens a new PR to trigger fresh reviews\n\n## Core Rules\n\n1. **Wait for reviews**: After creating a PR and marking it ready to review, wait 5 minutes for Google Code Assist and other agents to provide feedback\n2. **Retry if no comments**: If no comments are received after 5 minutes, wait 5 more minutes and try one last time\n3. **Address all comments**: Thoroughly review and implement all feedback from code reviews\n4. **Close and reopen**: Close the current PR and open a new one to trigger fresh reviews\n5. **Maximum 10 cycles**: Repeat the cycle for a maximum of 10 iterations\n\n## Workflow\n\n### Initial Setup:\n1. Create a new branch with a meaningful name that describes the changes\n2. Ensure the branch name is unique to avoid conflicts\n\n### Code Review Cycle (Repeat up to 10 times):\n1. **Create PR**: Open a pull request with clear title and description\n2. **Mark ready**: Immediately mark the PR as ready to review (not draft)\n3. **Wait for reviews**: \n   - Wait 5 minutes for Google Code Assist and other agents to provide feedback\n   - If no comments received, wait 5 more minutes and check one last time\n4. **Review comments**: Read and analyze all code review comments\n5. **Address feedback**: Implement all requested changes and fixes\n6. **Commit changes**: Commit the fixes to the local branch\n7. **Close PR**: Close the current pull request\n8. **Push changes**: Push the latest changes to the branch\n9. **Open new PR**: Create a new pull request to trigger fresh reviews\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### When Creating Pull Requests:\n1. Use `create_pr` function with `draft: false`\n2. Create meaningful branch names that describe the changes\n3. Follow repository templates if they exist\n4. Apply appropriate labels (e.g., \"enhancement\", \"bug\", \"documentation\")\n5. Include clear descriptions of changes made and purpose\n\n### When Addressing Comments:\n1. Read all comments thoroughly\n2. Implement all requested changes\n3. Verify tests pass after changes\n4. Update documentation (CHANGELOG.md, TODO.md) as needed\n\n## Error Handling\n\n- **Authentication issues**: Update remote URL with current GITHUB_TOKEN\n- **Branch conflicts**: Create new unique branch names\n- **No comments received**: After waiting 10 minutes total, proceed to close and reopen\n- **Maximum cycles reached**: Stop after 10 iterations and report completion\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Example Cycle:\n1. Create branch: `feat/code-review-cycle-agent`\n2. Open PR: \"feat: Add code review cycle microagent\"\n3. Wait 5 minutes for reviews\n4. If comments received, address them\n5. Close current PR\n6. Push changes\n7. Open new PR with updated description\n\n## Configuration\n\n- Use environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` for authentication\n- Default base branch: `main`\n- Always verify PR creation was successful\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- This microagent complements the existing PR Ready to Review and SheepVibes Rules microagents\n- Follow all repository testing requirements and validation workflows, including running the full test suite before each PR creation.\n- Update relevant documentation files upon completion of each cycle"}]}}, {"id": 8, "timestamp": "2025-10-07T00:54:01.754836", "source": "agent", "message": "Missing required parameters for function 'execute_bash': {'security_risk'}", "observation": "error", "content": "Missing required parameters for function 'execute_bash': {'security_risk'}", "extras": {"error_id": ""}}, {"id": 9, "timestamp": "2025-10-07T00:54:10.560236", "source": "agent", "message": "Running command: pwd && ls -la", "action": "run", "tool_call_metadata": {"function_name": "execute_bash", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01", "model_response": {"id": "gen-1759798441-jdWRfJeVBuS48XXm2sno", "created": 1759798441, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-v3.2-exp", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "I'll help you read PR #103 and start a review cycle addressing all code reviews.

fixed\\\" feature.\\n\\n## Changes Made\\n\\n### Backend Performance Optimization\\n- Fixed performance issue in `update_feed_url` function by replacing redundant `fetch_and_update_feed` call with direct `process_feed_entries` to avoid duplicate network requests\\n\\n### Frontend Configuration\\n- Updated API configuration to use relative paths for production deployment instead of hardcoded port 5001\\n\\n### Frontend Error Handling\\n- Fixed syntax error in `handleEditFeedSubmit` function\\n- Improved user experience in edit modal with proper error handling\\n\\n### Testing\\n- Updated test to match optimized implementation\\n- All tests passing (74 passed, 1 skipped)\\n\\n## Technical Details\\n- Backend: Modified `update_feed_url` to use `process_feed_entries` directly instead of calling `fetch_and_update_feed` again\\n- Frontend: Updated API_BASE_URL configuration for production compatibility\\n- Documentation: Updated CHANGELOG.md and TODO.md\\n\\n## Verification\\n- All three identified code review issues resolved\\n- Backend performance optimized by eliminating redundant network calls\\n- Frontend API configuration fixed for production deployment\\n- Error handling UX improved with proper syntax and user feedback\\n\\nThis addresses the feedback from the previous PR #100 review cycle.\",\n  \"created_at\": \"2025-10-07T00:44:01Z\",\n  \"updated_at\":
