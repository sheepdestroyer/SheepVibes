Opens a new PR to trigger fresh reviews\n\n## Core Rules\n\n1. **Wait for reviews**: After creating a PR and marking it ready to review, wait 5 minutes for Google Code Assist and other agents to provide feedback\n2. **Retry if no comments**: If no comments are received after 5 minutes, wait 5 more minutes and try one last time\n3. **Address all comments**: Thoroughly review and implement all feedback from code reviews\n4. **Close and reopen**: Close the current PR and open a new one to trigger fresh reviews\n5. **Maximum 10 cycles**: Repeat the cycle for a maximum of 10 iterations\n\n## Workflow\n\n### Initial Setup:\n1. Create a new branch with a meaningful name that describes the changes\n2.

Use `create_pr` function with `draft: false`\n2. Create meaningful branch names that describe the changes\n3. Follow repository templates if they exist\n4. Apply appropriate labels (e.g., \"enhancement\", \"bug\", \"documentation\")\n5. Include clear descriptions of changes made and purpose\n\n### When Addressing Comments:\n1. Read all comments thoroughly\n2. Implement all requested changes\n3. Verify tests pass after changes\n4. Update documentation (CHANGELOG.md, TODO.md) as needed\n\n## Error Handling\n\n- **Authentication issues**: Update remote URL with current GITHUB_TOKEN\n- **Branch conflicts**: Create new unique branch names\n- **No comments received**: After waiting 10 minutes total, proceed to close and reopen\n- **Maximum cycles reached**: Stop after 10 iterations and report completion\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Example Cycle:\n1.

The changes look good overall, with solid new tests for the backend `update_feed_url` endpoint and significant UI/UX improvements on the frontend, such as using a modal for editing and providing inline error messages. I've found an issue related to the new error handling logic in the frontend. The `fetchData` helper function currently catches errors and displays a generic `alert`, which prevents the new, more specific inline error UI in the edit modal from working. My review includes a suggestion to refactor this to ensure errors are handled consistently and provide a better user experience.\",\n    \"state\": \"COMMENTED\",\n    \"html_url\":

The `catch` block is currently unreachable, and failed requests do not provide any feedback to the user in the UI.\\n\\nThe root cause is that the `fetchData` helper function catches all exceptions, shows a generic `alert()`, and returns `null` instead of re-throwing the error. Consequently, a failure in `fetchData` results in `result` being `null`, which executes the `else` block (lines 680-682). This block only logs to the console, leaving the user with a disabled \\\"Saving...\\\" button and no indication of what went wrong.\\n\\nTo fix this and make your new inline error display work as intended, two changes are needed:\\n\\n1.  **Modify `fetchData` to re-throw errors:** The `catch` block in `fetchData` (lines 150-154) should be changed to not show an `alert` and to re-throw the error, allowing the caller to handle it.\\n\\n    ```javascript\\n    // In fetchData()\\n    } catch (error) {\\n        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);\\n        throw error; // Re-throw the error instead of returning null\\n    }\\n    ```\\n\\n2.  **Remove the `else` block in this function:** With `fetchData` throwing errors, the `else` block here becomes unnecessary and should be removed. The `catch` block will then correctly handle all error scenarios.\\n\\nAfter these changes, a failed request will be caught by this `catch` block, and the user will see the intended error message in the modal.\",\n    \"created_at\": \"2025-10-07T07:24:15Z\",\n    \"updated_at\": \"2025-10-07T07:24:15Z\",\n    \"html_url\": \"https://github.com/sheepdestroyer/SheepVibes/pull/106#discussion_r2409653108\",\n    \"pull_request_url\": \"https://api.github.com/repos/sheepdestroyer/SheepVibes/pulls/106\",\n    \"author_association\": \"CONTRIBUTOR\",\n    \"_links\": {\n      \"self\": {\n        \"href\": \"https://api.github.com/repos/sheepdestroyer/SheepVibes/pulls/comments/2409653108\"\n      },\n      \"html\": {\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/sheepdestroyer/SheepVibes/pull/106#discussion_r2409653108\"\n      },\n      \"pull_request\": {\n        \"href\": \"https://api.github.com/repos/sheepdestroyer/SheepVibes/pulls/106\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"reactions\": {\n      \"url\": \"https://api.github.com/repos/sheepdestroyer/SheepVibes/pulls/comments/2409653108/reactions\",\n      \"total_count\": 0,\n      \"+1\": 0,\n      \"-1\": 0,\n      \"laugh\": 0,\n      \"hooray\": 0,\n      \"confused\": 0,\n      \"heart\": 0,\n      \"rocket\": 0,\n      \"eyes\": 0\n    },\n    \"start_line\": 650,\n    \"original_start_line\": 650,\n    \"start_side\": \"RIGHT\",\n    \"line\": 692,\n    \"original_line\": 692,\n    \"side\": \"RIGHT\",\n    \"original_position\": 215,\n    \"position\": 215,\n    \"subject_type\": \"line\"\n  }\n]", "extras": {"command": "curl -H \"Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN\" \"https://api.github.com/repos/sheepdestroyer/SheepVibes/pulls/106/comments\"", "metadata": {"exit_code": 0, "pid": -1, "username": "root", "hostname": "f99140bd49a8", "working_dir": "/workspace/SheepVibes/backend", "py_interpreter_path": "/openhands/micromamba/envs/openhands/bin/python", "prefix": "", "suffix": "\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]"}, "hidden": false}, "success": true}, {"id": 149, "timestamp": "2025-10-07T14:51:29.949431", "source": "agent", "message": "Managing 5 task items.", "action": "task_tracking", "tool_call_metadata": {"function_name": "task_tracker", "tool_call_id": "toolu_23", "model_response": {"id": "gen-1759848677-JofOa15VofXQyKEZbf6e", "created": 1759848677, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-v3.2-exp", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ffc7281d48_prod0820_fp8_kvcache", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "Perfect!
