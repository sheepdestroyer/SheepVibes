I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!\\\\n\\\\nThis pull request introduces a significant new feature to the SheepVibes application, allowing users to dynamically modify the URLs of their RSS feed widgets. This enhancement provides greater flexibility and control over their personalized news feeds, moving beyond static feed configurations. The changes span both the backend, with a new API endpoint for updates, and the frontend, with an intuitive user interface for editing, ensuring a robust and user-friendly experience.\\\\n\\\\n### Highlights\\\\n\\\\n* **Editable Feed URLs**: Users can now edit feed URLs directly from the frontend UI, providing greater flexibility in managing their RSS feeds.\\\\n* **Backend API Extension**: A new `PUT /api/feeds/<feed_id>` endpoint has been added to the backend for updating feed URLs and properties, including robust validation and automatic name/site link updates.\\\\n* **Interactive Frontend**: Each feed widget now features an edit button (\\u270e) that opens a modal dialog for URL editing, complete with form validation and automatic feed refresh upon successful update.\\\\n* **CORS Configuration**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) has been configured on the backend to enable seamless communication with the frontend, especially when running on different ports or domains.\\\\n* **Comprehensive Testing**: New unit tests have been added for the `PUT` endpoint, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the feed update functionality.\\\\n* **Documentation Updates**: The `CHANGELOG.md` and `TODO.md` files have been updated to reflect the new feature and completed development tasks.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n<details>\\\\n<summary><b>Using Gemini Code Assist</b></summary>\\\\n<br>\\\\n\\\\nThe full guide for Gemini Code Assist can be found on our [documentation page](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/review-github-code), here are some quick tips.\\\\n\\\\n<b>Invoking Gemini</b>\\\\n\\\\nYou can request assistance from Gemini at any point by creating a comment using either `/gemini <command>` or `@gemini-code-assist <command>`.
