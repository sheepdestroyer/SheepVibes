Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"description": "The commands to run.

deploy SheepVibes using a Podman Pod managed by systemd user services, leveraging Quadlet for easier unit file management.\n    21\t\n    22\t### Prerequisites\n    23\t\n    24\t- `podman` and `curl` installed (the deployment script will check for these).\n    25\t- Git (optional, if you prefer to clone the repository).\n    26\t- A modern version of Podman that includes Quadlet support.\n    27\t\n    28\t### Setup Instructions\n    29\t\n    30\t1.  **Obtain the Deployment Script**:\n    31\t\n    32\t    For the stable version, always refer to the `main` branch:\n    33\t    ```bash\n    34\t    # Stable version from main:\n    35\t    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sheepdestroyer/sheepvibes/main/scripts/deploy_pod.sh\n    36\t    ```\n    37\t\n    38\t2.  **Make the Script Executable and Run It**:\n    39\t    Navigate to where you downloaded the script (or the repository root if cloned).\n    40\t    The script will fetch the necessary Quadlet unit files (e.g., `sheepvibespod.pod`, `sheepvibes-app.container`, `sheepvibes-db.volume`, etc.) from the `pod/quadlet/` directory in the GitHub repository (from the `main` branch, unless modified) and copy them to `~/.config/containers/systemd/`. Volume management is defined within these Quadlet files.\n    41\t\n    42\t    ```bash\n    43\t    chmod +x deploy_pod.sh # Or scripts/deploy_pod.sh if cloned\n    44\t    ./deploy_pod.sh      # Or scripts/deploy_pod.sh if cloned\n    45\t    ```\n    46\t    The script will check for dependencies, guide you through the process, and inform you of the next steps.\n    47\t\n    48\t3.  **Manage the Service**:\n    49\t    After running the deployment script, you will be instructed to:\n    50\t    -   Reload systemd to recognize the new Quadlet files and generate systemd services:\n    51\t        ```bash\n    52\t        systemctl --user daemon-reload\n    53\t        ```\n    54\t    -   Start the main pod service (which in turn starts all containers and creates volumes):\n    55\t        ```bash\n    56\t        systemctl --user start sheepvibespod-pod.service\n    57\t        ```\n    58\t    -   Check the status of the pod and its components:\n    59\t        ```bash\n    60\t        systemctl --user status sheepvibespod-pod.service\n    61\t        systemctl --user status sheepvibes-app.service\n    62\t        systemctl --user status sheepvibes-redis.service\n    63\t        # You can also check the status of volume services (they are Type=oneshot)\n    64\t        systemctl --user status sheepvibes-db-volume.service\n    65\t        systemctl --user status sheepvibes-redis-data-volume.service\n    66\t        ```\n    67\t    -   View logs for the entire pod (follow):\n    68\t        ```bash\n    69\t        journalctl --user -u sheepvibespod-pod.service -f\n    70\t        ```\n    71\t    -   View logs for a specific container (e.g., `sheepvibes-app`):\n    72\t        ```bash\n    73\t        journalctl --user -u sheepvibespod-pod.service -t sheepvibes-app\n    74\t        # Or for more detailed logs of just the app container's service:\n    75\t        journalctl --user -u sheepvibes-app.service -f\n    76\t        ```\n    77\t    The `sheepvibes-redis` container runs within the same pod and is managed as part of `sheepvibespod-pod.service`. Network communication between the app and Redis occurs over `localhost` within the pod. Application data and Redis data are stored in Podman-managed volumes (e.g., `systemd-sheepvibes-db` and `systemd-sheepvibes-redis-data` by default), defined via `.volume` Quadlet files.\n    78\t\n    79\t4.  **Enable Auto-start (Optional)**:\n    80\t    The `pod/quadlet/sheepvibespod.pod` file includes an `[Install]` section with `WantedBy=default.target`. This means that after you run `systemctl --user daemon-reload` (as instructed by the `deploy_pod.sh` script), the main pod service (`sheepvibespod-pod.service`) is automatically configured to start when your user session begins.\n    81\t\n    82\t    No separate `systemctl --user enable sheepvibespod-pod.service` command is needed, and attempting to run it on the generated service will result in an error.\n    83\t\n    84\t    To verify auto-start, you can log out and log back in. The service should start automatically.\n    85\t\n    86\t    *Note on system boot*: For user services to start automatically when the system boots (i.e., without requiring an interactive login for that user), you may need to enable lingering for your user. This typically requires root privileges:\n    87\t    ```bash\n    88\t    sudo loginctl enable-linger $(whoami)\n    89\t    ```\n    90\t\n    91\t### Accessing the Application\n    92\t\n    93\tOnce started, the application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` by default. This is configured by the `PublishPort` setting in the `[Pod]` section of the `pod/quadlet/sheepvibespod.pod` file. If you need to access it from other machines, you might need to:\n    94\t1.  Adjust firewall settings on your server.\n    95\t2.  Modify the `PublishPort` setting in the `pod/quadlet/sheepvibespod.pod` file (e.g., change to `0.0.0.0:5000:5000`).\n    96\t    - If you modify it *before* running `deploy_pod.sh` (e.g., in a cloned repository), the script will use your modified version if it's fetching from your local clone or a specific branch.\n    97\t    - If you modify it *after* deployment by editing `~/.config/containers/systemd/sheepvibespod.pod`, you'll need to run `systemctl --user daemon-reload && systemctl --user restart sheepvibespod-pod.service`.\n    98\t\n    99\t## Local Development\n   100\t\n   101\tThis section describes how to set up SheepVibes for local development and testing. This typically involves cloning the repository to get all source files and the `Containerfile`.\n   102\t\n   103\t### Prerequisites\n   104\t\n   105\t- Podman installed.\n   106\t- Git.\n   107\t- Python environment (optional, for direct backend/frontend work without containers).\n   108\t\n   109\t### Building the Container\n   110\t\n   111\t1.  **Clone the Repository**:\n   112\t    ```bash\n   113\t    git clone https://github.com/sheepdestroyer/sheepvibes.git\n   114\t    cd sheepvibes\n   115\t    ```\n   116\t\n   117\t2.  **Build the Image**:\n   118\t    Build the application image using the `Containerfile`:\n   119\t    ```bash\n   120\t    podman build -t localhost/sheepvibes-app -f Containerfile .\n   121\t    ```\n   122\t    Alternatively, use the provided script:\n   123\t    ```bash\n   124\t    # Make sure it's executable first: chmod +x scripts/rebuild_container.sh\n   125\t    ./scripts/rebuild_container.sh\n   126\t    ```\n   127\t    After rebuilding the image, if you are using systemd for production, you must restart the service to use the new image: `systemctl --user restart sheepvibespod-pod.service` (this will recreate containers with the updated image if their `Pull` policy allows or if the image tag changed and Quadlet detects it). Podman typically restarts containers with the newest image version if the image name/tag in the `.container` file is `:latest` and the image is updated locally.\n   128\t\n   129\t### Running Locally with Podman\n   130\t\n   131\t1.  **Create a Podman Network**:\n   132\t    ```bash\n   133\t    podman network create sheepvibes-dev-network\n   134\t    ```\n   135\t\n   136\t2.  **Start Redis Container**:\n   137\t    ```bash\n   138\t    podman run -d --name sheepvibes-redis-dev --network sheepvibes-dev-network docker.io/library/redis:alpine\n   139\t    ```\n   140\t\n   141\t3.  **Run the Application Container**:\n   142\t    Create a local directory for the database:\n   143\t    ```bash\n   144\t    mkdir -p ./dev_data\n   145\t    ```\n   146\t    Run the application container, linking it to Redis and mounting the local data directory:\n   147\t    ```bash\n   148\t    podman run -d --name sheepvibes-app-dev \\\n   149\t        --network sheepvibes-dev-network \\\n   150\t        -p 127.0.0.1:5001:5000 \\\n   151\t        -v ./dev_data:/app/data:Z \\\n   152\t        -e DATABASE_PATH=/app/data/sheepvibes.db \\\n   153\t        -e CACHE_REDIS_URL=redis://sheepvibes-redis-dev:6379/0 \\\n   154\t        -e FLASK_APP=backend.app \\\n   155\t        -e PYTHONPATH=/app \\\n   156\t        -e UPDATE_INTERVAL_MINUTES=15 \\\n   157\t        -e FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0 \\\n   158\t        localhost/sheepvibes-app\n   159\t    ```\n   160\t    You can then access the app at `http://127.0.0.1:5001`. Logs can be viewed with `podman logs sheepvibes-app-dev`.\n   161\t\n   162\t4.  **Using `run_dev.sh` (Alternative)**:\n   163\t    The `scripts/run_dev.sh` script provides a way to manage the local development containers. Review and modify it as needed for your local setup.\n   164\t    *(Note: You might need to update `scripts/run_dev.sh` if it's outdated or doesn't match the above setup. The script primarily focuses on running the backend directly without containers for faster iteration).*\n   165\t\n   166\t### Direct Backend/Frontend Development\n   167\t\n   168\tThis section is for developers who want to work on the Python backend or JavaScript frontend directly, without running the full application in Podman.\n   169\t\n   170\t1.  **Prerequisites:**\n   171\t    *   Ensure you have Python 3, `pip`, and a running Redis server (e.g., `podman run -d --name sheepvibes-redis-direct -p 127.0.0.1:6379:6379 redis:alpine`).\n   172\t\n   173\t2.  **Set up Backend Virtual Environment (requires cloning the repo):**\n   174\t    *   Navigate to the `backend` directory: `cd sheepvibes/backend`\n   175\t    *   Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`\n   176\t    *   Activate it: `source venv/bin/activate` (or `venv\\Scripts\\activate` on Windows)\n   177\t    *   Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`\n   178\t\n   179\t3.  **Run the Development Server (Flask Backend - requires cloning the repo):**\n   180\t    The `scripts/run_dev.sh` script can start the Flask backend server directly.\n   181\t    Ensure `CACHE_REDIS_URL` is set, e.g. `export CACHE_REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0`\n   182\t    ```bash\n   183\t    # from the repository root (e.g., cd sheepvibes)\n   184\t    ./scripts/run_dev.sh\n   185\t    ```\n   186\t    This will typically start the backend on `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (or as configured). The frontend is served statically by Flask in this mode.\n   187\t\n   188\t## Configuration (Environment Variables)\n   189\t\n   190\tYou can configure the application by passing environment variables.\n   191\t- When deploying with systemd using Quadlet (via `deploy_pod.sh`), the script downloads a set of default Quadlet files (e.g., `sheepvibes-app.container`, `sheepvibespod.pod`) from `pod/quadlet/`. To customize environment variables for the application:\n   192\t    1. Modify the `Environment=` lines within the `pod/quadlet/sheepvibes-app.container` file (or your local copy at `~/.config/containers/systemd/sheepvibes-app.container` after deployment).\n   193\t    2. After modification, run `systemctl --user daemon-reload && systemctl --user restart sheepvibespod-pod.service`.\n   194\t- When using `podman run` directly, use the `-e` flag.\n   195\t- When running the backend directly, set them in your shell environment.\n   196\t\n   197\t*   `DATABASE_PATH`: The full path *inside the container* (or on the host if running directly) where the SQLite database file should be stored. Defaults to `/app/data/sheepvibes.db` (container) or `backend/sheepvibes.db` (direct script). This path is relative to the volume mount specified in `sheepvibes-app.container`.\n   198\t*   `UPDATE_INTERVAL_MINUTES`: The interval (in minutes) at which the application checks feeds for updates. Defaults to `15`.\n   199\t*   `CACHE_REDIS_URL`: The connection URL for the Redis server.\n   200\t    *   Pod default (from `sheepvibes-app.container`): `redis://localhost:6379/0` (since Redis is in the same pod).\n   201\t    *   `podman run` dev example: `redis://sheepvibes-redis-dev:6379/0`\n   202\t    *   Direct script: `redis://localhost:6379/0` (if Redis is on host)\n   203\t*   `FLASK_APP`: Path to the Flask application.

Then, validate all tests by executing the full dedicated CI workflow as described in this document.\n    11\t4. Only then, start the next step.\n    12\t  \n    13\t### Finishing a task :\n    14\t5. Before preparing to end a task it is necessary to run a last full validation of all tests.\n    15\t6.

Only then will the task be completed, and changes be submitted / commited.\n    17\t\n    18\t## CI/CD and Automated Agent Execution Guide\n    19\t\n    20\tAutomated environments, such as those used by Google's Jules, operate in restricted settings where service ports may be mapped dynamically. The project's test suite is designed to handle this.\n    21\t\n    22\t**The most reliable reference is the project's own CI workflow, located at `.github/workflows/run-tests.yml`.** This file demonstrates exactly how to set up the environment and execute the tests. Agents should replicate this setup.\n    23\t\n    24\t### Key Configuration Points for Automated Agents:\n    25\t\n    26\t1.  **Service Containerization**: The tests require a running Redis service for caching checks. In the GitHub Actions workflow, this is accomplished using the `services` block to start a `redis:alpine` container. Your environment must provide a Redis container accessible to the test runner.\n    27\t\n    28\t2.  **Dynamic Port Handling**: In CI systems, you cannot assume Redis will be available on `localhost:6379`. The service container's port `6379` will be mapped to a *dynamic port* on the host runner. The GitHub Actions workflow retrieves this port using `${{ job.services.redis.ports['6379'] }}`.\n    29\t\n    30\t3.  **Environment Variable**: The test suite (`backend/test_app.py`) is explicitly configured to look for the `CACHE_REDIS_PORT` environment variable. If this variable is set, it will override the default Redis port and allow the tests to connect to the dynamically mapped port of the Redis service container.\n    31\t\n    32\t### Actionable Steps for Automated Agents:\n    33\t\n    34\tTo successfully run the backend tests, please follow this procedure, which mirrors our CI workflow:\n    35\t\n    36\t1.  **Start a Redis service container** within your environment, and **Identify the host port** that has been dynamically mapped to the container's internal port `6379`.\n    37\t2.  **Set the `CACHE_REDIS_PORT` environment variable** to this dynamically assigned port number.\n    38\t3.  Navigate to the `backend` directory, and **Install dependencies**: `cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt`.\n    39\t4.  **Run the tests** using the command: `python -m pytest -v`.\n    40\t\n    41\tBy following these instructions, which mirror the setup in our own CI workflow, automated tools should be able to execute the full test suite correctly. Always ensure it succeeds before submitting your changes.\n    42\t\n", "extras": {"path": "/workspace/SheepVibes/AGENTS.md", "impl_source": "oh_aci"}}, {"id": 16, "timestamp":
