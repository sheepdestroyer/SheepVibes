I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!\\\\n\\\\nThis pull request introduces a significant new feature to the SheepVibes application, allowing users to dynamically edit the URLs of their RSS feed widgets. This enhancement improves user control and flexibility by providing a dedicated frontend interface for updating feed sources, backed by a robust new API endpoint. The changes span both the backend and frontend, ensuring a cohesive and functional user experience, and include necessary infrastructure updates like CORS configuration.\\\\n\\\\n### Highlights\\\\n\\\\n* **Editable Feed URLs**: Users can now edit feed URLs directly from the frontend UI, enhancing control over their RSS feeds.\\\\n* **Backend API Extension**: A new PUT /api/feeds/<feed_id> endpoint has been added to update feed URLs and properties, including validation and automatic name/site link updates.\\\\n* **Interactive Frontend**: Each feed widget now features an edit button (\\u270e) that opens a modal dialog for URL modification, complete with form validation and dynamic content refresh.\\\\n* **CORS Configuration**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) has been configured to enable seamless communication between the frontend and backend.\\\\n* **Comprehensive Testing**: New unit tests have been added for the PUT endpoint, ensuring robust functionality and covering various scenarios like successful updates, failed fetches, and conflicts.\\\\n* **Documentation Updates**: CHANGELOG.md and TODO.md have been updated to reflect the new feature and completed tasks.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n<details>\\\\n<summary><b>Using Gemini Code Assist</b></summary>\\\\n<br>\\\\n\\\\nThe full guide for Gemini Code Assist can be found on our [documentation page](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/review-github-code), here are some quick tips.\\\\n\\\\n<b>Invoking Gemini</b>\\\\n\\\\nYou can request assistance from Gemini at any point by creating a comment using either `/gemini <command>` or `@gemini-code-assist <command>`.
