I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!\\n\\nThis pull request introduces a significant feature allowing users to modify the source URL for individual RSS feed widgets within the SheepVibes application. The change encompasses both backend and frontend development, providing a dedicated API endpoint for updates, a user-friendly modal interface for editing, and necessary infrastructure adjustments like CORS. This enhancement improves the flexibility and maintainability of user-managed feeds.\\n\\n### Highlights\\n\\n* **Editable Feed URLs**: Users can now edit the URL of any existing feed widget directly from the frontend, enhancing feed management capabilities.\\n* **Backend API Endpoint**: A new PUT /api/feeds/<feed\\\\_id> endpoint has been added to the backend, allowing updates to a feed's URL, name, and site link with robust validation.\\n* **Frontend User Interface**: An 'edit' button (\\u270e) has been integrated into each feed widget, which opens a modal dialog for users to input a new feed URL. The UI includes form validation and automatic refresh of feed content upon successful update.\\n* **CORS Configuration**: CORS has been configured in the backend to ensure seamless communication between the frontend and the newly introduced API endpoint.\\n* **Comprehensive Testing**: New tests have been added for the PUT endpoint, covering various scenarios including successful updates, invalid URLs, and duplicate URLs, ensuring the reliability of the new feature.\\n\\n**Using Gemini Code Assist**\\n\\nThe full guide for Gemini Code Assist can be found on our [documentation page](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/review-github-code), here are some quick tips.\\n\\n**Invoking Gemini**\\n\\nYou can request assistance from Gemini at any point by creating a comment using either `/gemini <command>` or `@gemini-code-assist <command>`.
