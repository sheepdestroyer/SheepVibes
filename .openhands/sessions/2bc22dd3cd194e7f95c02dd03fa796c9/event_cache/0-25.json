Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"description": "The commands to run.

Start Redis container: `podman run -d --rm --name sheepvibes-test-redis -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine`\n2. Install dependencies: `cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt`\n3. Run tests: `python -m pytest -v`\n\n### CI/CD Reference\n- **Definitive guide**: `.github/workflows/run-tests.yml`\n- **Service containerization**: Redis service with dynamic port mapping\n- **Environment setup**: Set `CACHE_REDIS_PORT` for dynamic environments\n\n## Error Handling and Limitations\n- **Feed parsing**: Handle timeouts, invalid URLs, bad feed formats\n- **Database constraints**: Use entry link as GUID to prevent UNIQUE constraint errors\n\n## Usage Examples\nWhen working on this repository, agents must:\n- Always start by reading all markdown files\n- Follow the step-by-step validation workflow\n- Replicate CI environment setup for testing\n- Update documentation files upon task completion\n\n## Important Notes\n- The repository follows a strict validation-first approach\n- All changes must be tested and validated before proceeding\n- Documentation updates are part of the completion criteria", "runtime_hosts": {"http://localhost:52910": 52910, "http://localhost:57562": 57562}, "additional_agent_instructions": "", "date": "2025-10-06", "custom_secrets_descriptions": {}, "conversation_instructions": "Target file: /sheepvibes-rules.md\n\nDescription: After pushing a first time to GitHub, on subsequent pushes : Close the current PR and open a new one to trigger a new Google Code Assist code review\n\nTriggers: newpr", "working_dir": "/workspace", "microagent_knowledge": [{"name": "github", "trigger": "github", "content": "You have access to an environment variable, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which allows you to interact with\nthe GitHub API.\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nYou can use `curl` with the `GITHUB_TOKEN` to interact with GitHub's API.\nALWAYS use the GitHub API for operations instead of a web browser.\nALWAYS use the `create_pr` tool to open a pull request\n</IMPORTANT>\n\nIf you encounter authentication issues when pushing to GitHub (such as password prompts or permission errors), the old token may have expired.
