Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

Set `draft: false` when using the `create_pr` function\n2. Include clear, descriptive titles and descriptions\n3. Reference any related issues or context\n4. Ensure code passes local checks and is ready for review before creating the PR\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n1. Use the GitHub API directly via `create_pr` function\n2. Set appropriate labels based on the changes (e.g., \"enhancement\", \"bug\", \"documentation\")\n3. Update relevant documentation files (CHANGELOG.md, TODO.md) as needed\n\n## Error Handling\n\n- If authentication fails, update remote URL with current GITHUB_TOKEN\n- If branch conflicts occur, create a new unique branch name\n- Always verify the PR was created successfully\n\n## Usage Examples\n\nWhen creating a PR for a new feature:\n- Title: \"feat: Add new widget functionality\"\n- Labels: \"enhancement\"\n- Description: Include purpose, changes made, and testing results\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- This microagent focuses on the PR creation process specifically\n- It complements the existing SheepVibes Rules microagent\n- Follow all existing repository rules and testing requirements\n\n## Configuration\n\n- Use environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` for authentication\n- Default base branch: `main`\n- Always create meaningful branch names that describe the changes\n\n# SheepVibes Repository Rules and Guidelines\n\nThis microagent provides comprehensive knowledge about the SheepVibes RSS/Atom feed aggregator repository, including development workflows, testing requirements, and deployment procedures.\n\n## Core Rules for AI Agents\n\n### Mandatory Workflow Steps\n1. **Read all `.md` files** from the repository before starting any task\n2. **Read both backend & frontend code files** to understand the application's logic\n3. **For each individual step** during a task:\n   - Add new relevant tests to the test suite\n   - Verify pre-existing tests are still valid, correct if necessary\n4. **Execute full CI workflow** as described in `.github/workflows/run-tests.yml`\n5. **Before task completion**:\n   - Run final full validation of all tests\n   - Update relevant `.md` files (especially `TODO.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`)\n\n### Testing Requirements\n- **Backend tests** require a running Redis service container\n- **Dynamic port handling** - Redis port is dynamically mapped in CI environments\n- **Environment variable**: Tests look for `CACHE_REDIS_PORT` to override default Redis port\n- **Full test suite execution** is mandatory before proceeding to next steps\n\n## Application Architecture\n\n### Backend (Python/Flask)\n- **Framework**: Flask with SQLAlchemy ORM\n- **Database**: SQLite with migrations\n- **Caching**: Redis for performance optimization\n- **Background tasks**: APScheduler for automatic feed updates\n- **API**: RESTful endpoints for tabs, feeds, and feed items\n\n### Frontend (Vanilla JavaScript)\n- **No frameworks** - pure JavaScript, HTML, CSS\n- **Real-time updates**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live feed updates\n- **UI**: Netvibes/iGoogle-inspired grid layout\n\n## Development Environment Setup\n\n### Production Deployment (Podman Pod with systemd/Quadlet)\n- Use `scripts/deploy_pod.sh` for stable deployment\n- Pod includes: app container, Redis container, persistent volumes\n- Auto-start configured via systemd user services\n\n### Local Development Options\n1. **Podman containers** with development network\n2. **Direct backend/frontend** development with virtual environment\n\n## Key Configuration Variables\n- `DATABASE_PATH`: SQLite database file location\n- `UPDATE_INTERVAL_MINUTES`: Feed update frequency (default: 15)\n- `CACHE_REDIS_URL`: Redis connection URL\n\n## Testing Procedures\n\n### Backend Testing\n1. Start Redis container: `podman run -d --rm --name sheepvibes-test-redis -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine`\n2. Install dependencies: `cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt`\n3.

After making a first PR on a branch (and marked it ready to review), always wait 5 minutes to give time to Google Code Assist and other agents to make a code reviews. Then check and read all comments on the open PR. If there is no comment from Google Code Assist yet, wait 5 more minutes and try one last time.\n2.  Address all code review comments if any\n3. Close the Current PR.\n4. Push the latest changes, and open a new PR to trigger a new code review from Google Code Assist and other agents.\n\nRepeat this cycle for 10 times maximum.. Please be noted that the microagent doesn't have any triggers.\n\n- Step 2: Create a new branch for the repository sheepdestroyer/SheepVibes, must avoid duplicated branches.\n\n- Step 3: Please push the changes to your branch on GitHub and create a pull request.

"content": "---\nname: PR Ready to Review\ntype: knowledge\nversion: 1.0.0\nagent: CodeActAgent\ntriggers: []\n---\n\n# PR Ready to Review Microagent\n\nThis microagent provides guidance for ensuring that pull requests are immediately marked as \"ready to review\" after opening them.\n\n## Purpose\n\nEnsure that all pull requests created in the SheepVibes repository are immediately marked as ready for review, rather than being left as draft PRs.\n\n## Core Rules\n\n1. **Always mark PRs as ready to review** immediately after opening them\n2. **Never leave PRs in draft state** unless explicitly requested by the user\n3. **Apply appropriate labels** when creating PRs\n4. **Follow repository templates** if they exist\n\n## Workflow\n\n### When Creating a Pull Request:\n1. Set `draft: false` when using the `create_pr` function\n2. Include clear, descriptive titles and descriptions\n3. Reference any related issues or context\n4. Ensure code passes local checks and is ready for review before creating the PR\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n1. Use the GitHub API directly via `create_pr` function\n2. Set appropriate labels based on the changes (e.g., \"enhancement\", \"bug\", \"documentation\")\n3. Update relevant documentation files (CHANGELOG.md, TODO.md) as needed\n\n## Error Handling\n\n- If authentication fails, update remote URL with current GITHUB_TOKEN\n- If branch conflicts occur, create a new unique branch name\n- Always verify the PR was created successfully\n\n## Usage Examples\n\nWhen creating a PR for a new feature:\n- Title: \"feat: Add new widget functionality\"\n- Labels: \"enhancement\"\n- Description: Include purpose, changes made, and testing results\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- This microagent focuses on the PR creation process specifically\n- It complements the existing SheepVibes Rules microagent\n- Follow all existing repository rules and testing requirements\n\n## Configuration\n\n- Use environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` for authentication\n- Default base branch: `main`\n- Always create meaningful branch names that describe the changes\n---\nname: SheepVibes Rules\ntype: knowledge\nversion: 1.0.0\nagent: CodeActAgent\ntriggers: []\n---\n\n# SheepVibes Repository Rules and Guidelines\n\nThis microagent provides comprehensive knowledge about the SheepVibes RSS/Atom feed aggregator repository, including development workflows, testing requirements, and deployment procedures.\n\n## Core Rules for AI Agents\n\n### Mandatory Workflow Steps\n1. **Read all `.md` files** from the repository before starting any task\n2. **Read both backend & frontend code files** to understand the application's logic\n3. **For each individual step** during a task:\n   - Add new relevant tests to the test suite\n   - Verify pre-existing tests are still valid, correct if necessary\n4. **Execute full CI workflow** as described in `.github/workflows/run-tests.yml`\n5. **Before task completion**:\n   - Run final full validation of all tests\n   - Update relevant `.md` files (especially `TODO.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`)\n\n### Testing Requirements\n- **Backend tests** require a running Redis service container\n- **Dynamic port handling** - Redis port is dynamically mapped in CI environments\n- **Environment variable**: Tests look for `CACHE_REDIS_PORT` to override default Redis port\n- **Full test suite execution** is mandatory before proceeding to next steps\n\n## Application Architecture\n\n### Backend (Python/Flask)\n- **Framework**: Flask with SQLAlchemy ORM\n- **Database**: SQLite with migrations\n- **Caching**: Redis for performance optimization\n- **Background tasks**: APScheduler for automatic feed updates\n- **API**: RESTful endpoints for tabs, feeds, and feed items\n\n### Frontend (Vanilla JavaScript)\n- **No frameworks** - pure JavaScript, HTML, CSS\n- **Real-time updates**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live feed updates\n- **UI**: Netvibes/iGoogle-inspired grid layout\n\n## Development Environment Setup\n\n### Production Deployment (Podman Pod with systemd/Quadlet)\n- Use `scripts/deploy_pod.sh` for stable deployment\n- Pod includes: app container, Redis container, persistent volumes\n- Auto-start configured via systemd user services\n\n### Local Development Options\n1. **Podman containers** with development network\n2. **Direct backend/frontend** development with virtual environment\n\n## Key Configuration Variables\n- `DATABASE_PATH`: SQLite database file location\n- `UPDATE_INTERVAL_MINUTES`: Feed update frequency (default: 15)\n- `CACHE_REDIS_URL`: Redis connection URL\n\n## Testing Procedures\n\n### Backend Testing\n1. Start Redis container: `podman run -d --rm --name sheepvibes-test-redis -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine`\n2. Install dependencies: `cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt`\n3. Run tests: `python -m pytest -v`\n\n### CI/CD Reference\n- **Definitive guide**: `.github/workflows/run-tests.yml`\n- **Service containerization**: Redis service with dynamic port mapping\n- **Environment setup**: Set `CACHE_REDIS_PORT` for dynamic environments\n\n## Error Handling and Limitations\n- **Feed parsing**: Handle timeouts, invalid URLs, bad feed formats\n- **Database constraints**: Use entry link as GUID to prevent UNIQUE constraint errors\n\n## Usage Examples\nWhen working on this repository, agents must:\n- Always start by reading all markdown files\n- Follow the step-by-step validation workflow\n- Replicate CI environment setup for testing\n- Update documentation files upon task completion\n\n## Important Notes\n- The repository follows a strict validation-first approach\n- All changes must be tested and validated before proceeding\n- Documentation updates are part of the completion criteria", "extras": {"command": "cat

feed and per tab.\n*   Basic persistence using a database.\n\n## Production Deployment (Podman Pod with systemd using Quadlet)\n\nThis section describes how to deploy SheepVibes using a Podman Pod managed by systemd user services, leveraging Quadlet for easier unit file management.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- `podman` and `curl` installed (the deployment script will check for these).\n- Git (optional, if you prefer to clone the repository).\n- A modern version of Podman that includes Quadlet support.\n\n### Setup Instructions\n\n1.  **Obtain the Deployment Script**:\n\n    For the stable version, always refer to the `main` branch:\n    ```bash\n    # Stable version from main:\n    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sheepdestroyer/sheepvibes/main/scripts/deploy_pod.sh\n    ```\n\n2.  **Make the Script Executable and Run It**:\n    Navigate to where you downloaded the script (or the repository root if cloned).\n    The script will fetch the necessary Quadlet unit files (e.g., `sheepvibespod.pod`, `sheepvibes-app.container`, `sheepvibes-db.volume`, etc.) from the `pod/quadlet/` directory in the GitHub repository (from the `main` branch, unless modified) and copy them to `~/.config/containers/systemd/`. Volume management is defined within these Quadlet files.\n\n    ```bash\n    chmod +x deploy_pod.sh # Or scripts/deploy_pod.sh if cloned\n    ./deploy_pod.sh      # Or scripts/deploy_pod.sh if cloned\n    ```\n    The script will check for dependencies, guide you through the process, and inform you of the next steps.\n\n3.  **Manage the Service**:\n    After running the deployment script, you will be instructed to:\n    -   Reload systemd to recognize the new Quadlet files and generate systemd services:\n        ```bash\n        systemctl --user daemon-reload\n        ```\n    -   Start the main pod service (which in turn starts all containers and creates volumes):\n        ```bash\n        systemctl --user start sheepvibespod-pod.service\n        ```\n    -   Check the status of the pod and its components:\n        ```bash\n        systemctl --user status sheepvibespod-pod.service\n        systemctl --user status sheepvibes-app.service\n        systemctl --user status sheepvibes-redis.service\n        # You can also check the status of volume services (they are Type=oneshot)\n        systemctl --user status sheepvibes-db-volume.service\n        systemctl --user status sheepvibes-redis-data-volume.service\n        ```\n    -   View logs for the entire pod (follow):\n        ```bash\n        journalctl --user -u sheepvibespod-pod.service -f\n        ```\n    -   View logs for a specific container (e.g., `sheepvibes-app`):\n        ```bash\n        journalctl --user -u sheepvibespod-pod.service -t sheepvibes-app\n        # Or for more detailed logs of just the app container's service:\n        journalctl --user -u sheepvibes-app.service -f\n        ```\n    The `sheepvibes-redis` container runs within the same pod and is managed as part of `sheepvibespod-pod.service`. Network communication between the app and Redis occurs over `localhost` within the pod. Application data and Redis data are stored in Podman-managed volumes (e.g., `systemd-sheepvibes-db` and `systemd-sheepvibes-redis-data` by default), defined via `.volume` Quadlet files.\n\n4.  **Enable Auto-start (Optional)**:\n    The `pod/quadlet/sheepvibespod.pod` file includes an `[Install]` section with `WantedBy=default.target`. This means that after you run `systemctl --user daemon-reload` (as instructed by the `deploy_pod.sh` script), the main pod service (`sheepvibespod-pod.service`) is automatically configured to start when your user session begins.\n\n    No separate `systemctl --user enable sheepvibespod-pod.service` command is needed, and attempting to run it on the generated service will result in an error.\n\n    To verify auto-start, you can log out and log back in. The service should start automatically.\n\n    *Note on system boot*: For user services to start automatically when the system boots (i.e., without requiring an interactive login for that user), you may need to enable lingering for your user. This typically requires root privileges:\n    ```bash\n    sudo loginctl enable-linger $(whoami)\n    ```\n\n### Accessing the Application\n\nOnce started, the application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` by default. This is configured by the `PublishPort` setting in the `[Pod]` section of the `pod/quadlet/sheepvibespod.pod` file. If you need to access it from other machines, you might need to:\n1.  Adjust firewall settings on your server.\n2.  Modify the `PublishPort` setting in the `pod/quadlet/sheepvibespod.pod` file (e.g., change to `0.0.0.0:5000:5000`).\n    - If you modify it *before* running `deploy_pod.sh` (e.g., in a cloned repository), the script will use your modified version if it's fetching from your local clone or a specific branch.\n    - If you modify it *after* deployment by editing `~/.config/containers/systemd/sheepvibespod.pod`, you'll need to run `systemctl --user daemon-reload && systemctl --user restart sheepvibespod-pod.service`.\n\n## Local Development\n\nThis section describes how to set up SheepVibes for local development and testing. This typically involves cloning the repository to get all source files and the `Containerfile`.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Podman installed.\n- Git.\n- Python environment (optional, for direct backend/frontend work without containers).\n\n### Building the Container\n\n1.  **Clone the Repository**:\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/sheepdestroyer/sheepvibes.git\n    cd sheepvibes\n    ```\n\n2.  **Build the Image**:\n    Build the application image using the `Containerfile`:\n    ```bash\n    podman build -t localhost/sheepvibes-app -f Containerfile .\n    ```\n    Alternatively, use the provided script:\n    ```bash\n    # Make sure it's executable first: chmod +x scripts/rebuild_container.sh\n    ./scripts/rebuild_container.sh\n    ```\n    After rebuilding the image, if you are using systemd for production, you must restart the service to use the new image: `systemctl --user restart sheepvibespod-pod.service` (this will recreate containers with the updated image if their `Pull` policy allows or if the image tag changed and Quadlet detects it). Podman typically restarts containers with the newest image version if the image name/tag in the `.container` file is `:latest` and the image is updated locally.\n\n### Running Locally with Podman\n\n1.  **Create a Podman Network**:\n    ```bash\n    podman network create sheepvibes-dev-network\n    ```\n\n2.  **Start Redis Container**:\n    ```bash\n    podman run -d --name sheepvibes-redis-dev --network sheepvibes-dev-network docker.io/library/redis:alpine\n    ```\n\n3.  **Run the Application Container**:\n    Create a local directory for the database:\n    ```bash\n    mkdir -p ./dev_data\n    ```\n    Run the application container, linking it to Redis and mounting the local data directory:\n    ```bash\n    podman run -d --name sheepvibes-app-dev \\\n        --network sheepvibes-dev-network \\\n        -p 127.0.0.1:5001:5000 \\\n        -v ./dev_data:/app/data:Z \\\n        -e DATABASE_PATH=/app/data/sheepvibes.db \\\n        -e CACHE_REDIS_URL=redis://sheepvibes-redis-dev:6379/0 \\\n        -e FLASK_APP=backend.app \\\n        -e PYTHONPATH=/app \\\n        -e UPDATE_INTERVAL_MINUTES=15 \\\n        -e FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0 \\\n        localhost/sheepvibes-app\n    ```\n    You can then access the app at `http://127.0.0.1:5001`. Logs can be viewed with `podman logs sheepvibes-app-dev`.\n\n4.  **Using `run_dev.sh` (Alternative)**:\n    The `scripts/run_dev.sh` script provides a way to manage the local development containers. Review and modify it as needed for your local setup.\n    *(Note: You might need to update `scripts/run_dev.sh` if it's outdated or doesn't match the above setup. The script primarily focuses on running the backend directly without containers for faster iteration).*\n\n### Direct Backend/Frontend Development\n\nThis section is for developers who want to work on the Python backend or JavaScript frontend directly, without running the full application in Podman.\n\n1.  **Prerequisites:**\n    *   Ensure you have Python 3, `pip`, and a running Redis server (e.g., `podman run -d --name sheepvibes-redis-direct -p 127.0.0.1:6379:6379 redis:alpine`).\n\n2.  **Set up Backend Virtual Environment (requires cloning the repo):**\n    *   Navigate to the `backend` directory: `cd sheepvibes/backend`\n    *   Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`\n    *   Activate it: `source venv/bin/activate` (or `venv\\Scripts\\activate` on Windows)\n    *   Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`\n\n3.  **Run the Development Server (Flask Backend - requires cloning the repo):**\n    The `scripts/run_dev.sh` script can start the Flask backend server directly.\n    Ensure `CACHE_REDIS_URL` is set, e.g. `export CACHE_REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0`\n    ```bash\n    # from the repository root (e.g., cd sheepvibes)\n    ./scripts/run_dev.sh\n    ```\n    This will typically start the backend on `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (or as configured). The frontend is served statically by Flask in this mode.\n\n## Configuration (Environment Variables)\n\nYou can configure the application by passing environment variables.\n- When deploying with systemd using Quadlet (via `deploy_pod.sh`), the script downloads a set of default Quadlet files (e.g., `sheepvibes-app.container`, `sheepvibespod.pod`) from `pod/quadlet/`. To customize environment variables for the application:\n    1. Modify the `Environment=` lines within the `pod/quadlet/sheepvibes-app.container` file (or your local copy at `~/.config/containers/systemd/sheepvibes-app.container` after deployment).\n    2. After modification, run `systemctl --user daemon-reload && systemctl --user restart sheepvibespod-pod.service`.\n- When using `podman run` directly, use the `-e` flag.\n- When running the backend directly, set them in your shell environment.\n\n*   `DATABASE_PATH`: The full path *inside the container* (or on the host if running directly) where the SQLite database file should be stored. Defaults to `/app/data/sheepvibes.db` (container) or `backend/sheepvibes.db` (direct script). This path is relative to the volume mount specified in `sheepvibes-app.container`.\n*   `UPDATE_INTERVAL_MINUTES`: The interval (in minutes) at which the application checks feeds for updates. Defaults to `15`.\n*   `CACHE_REDIS_URL`: The connection URL for the Redis server.\n    *   Pod default (from `sheepvibes-app.container`): `redis://localhost:6379/0` (since Redis is in the same pod).\n    *   `podman run` dev example: `redis://sheepvibes-redis-dev:6379/0`\n    *   Direct script: `redis://localhost:6379/0` (if Redis is on host)\n*   `FLASK_APP`: Path to the Flask application. Defaults to `backend.app`.\n*   `PYTHONPATH`: Python module search path. Defaults to `/app` in container.\n*   `FLASK_RUN_HOST`: Host for Flask development server. Defaults to `0.0.0.0` to be accessible.\n\n## Contributing\n(Contributions are welcome.

This was causing a UNIQUE constraint failure in the database.\n  - This change modifies the `feed_service` to always use the entry's link as the GUID. The link is a reliable and unique identifier for each article, which will prevent this issue from happening in the future.\n# SheepVibes - Implementation Plan (TODO)\n\nThis document outlines the steps to build the SheepVibes RSS aggregator.\n\n## Phase 0: Project Setup & Core Backend\n\n*   [x] Initialize project structure (directories for backend, frontend, docs, etc.).\n*   [x] Set up Python virtual environment (`venv`).\n*   [x] Install initial Python dependencies (`Flask`, `feedparser`, `APScheduler`, `SQLAlchemy`).\n*   [x] Create a basic Flask application (`app.py`).\n*   [x] Define database schema/models (using `SQLAlchemy`):\n    *   `Tabs` (id, name, order)\n    *   `Feeds` (id, tab_id, name, url, last_updated_time)\n    *   `FeedItems` (id, feed_id, title, link, published_time, fetched_time, is_read)\n*   [x] Implement basic database initialization logic.\n*   [x] Create initial `Containerfile` for Podman (Python base image, install dependencies, expose port).\n*   [x] Set up basic logging.\n*   [x] Add `.gitignore`.\n\n## Phase 1: Feed Fetching & Processing\n\n*   [x] Create a service/module for fetching and parsing RSS/Atom feeds using `feedparser`.\n    *   Handle potential errors during fetching/parsing (timeouts, invalid URLs, bad feed formats).\n*   [x] Implement logic to store/update feed details and new items in the database.\n    *   Avoid duplicating existing items (check GUIDs or links).\n    *   Update `last_updated_time` for the feed.\n*   [x] Set up `APScheduler` as a background task within the Flask app (or as a separate process if preferred).\n    *   Schedule a recurring job to fetch updates for all configured feeds.\n    *   Make the interval configurable (e.g., every 15 minutes).\n*   [x] Implement initial backend API endpoints (using Flask):\n    *   `GET /api/tabs`: List all tabs.\n    *   `GET /api/tabs/<tab_id>/feeds`: List feeds for a specific tab.\n    *   `GET /api/feeds/<feed_id>/items`: List recent items for a specific feed (with limit/pagination).\n\n## Phase 2: Basic Frontend Structure & Display\n\n*   [x] Create basic HTML structure (`index.html`).\n    *   [x] Include placeholders for tabs.\n    *   [x] Include a container for the feed widget grid.\n*   [x] Create basic CSS (`style.css`) for layout:\n    *   [x] Style the tab bar.\n    *   [x] Implement a CSS Grid or Flexbox layout for the feed widgets.\n    *   [x] Style individual feed widgets (borders, padding, header, item list).\n*   [x] Write Vanilla JavaScript (`script.js`) to:\n    *   [x] Fetch tabs from `/api/tabs` on page load and render them.\n    *   [x] Fetch feeds for the initially active tab (`/api/tabs/<tab_id>/feeds`).\n    *   [x] For each feed, fetch its items (`/api/feeds/<feed_id>/items`).\n    *   [x] Render the feed widgets dynamically in the grid, populating them with titles and timestamps.\n    *   [x] Handle switching between tabs (fetch and render feeds for the selected tab).\n\n## Phase 3: Interactivity & Core Features\n\n*   [x] **Feed Management (Backend API):**\n    *   [x] `POST /api/feeds`: Add a new feed (URL, optionally associate with a tab). Backend should fetch initial data upon adding.\n    *   [x] `DELETE /api/feeds/<feed_id>`: Remove a feed.\n    *   [ ] `PUT /api/feeds/<feed_id>`: Update feed properties (e.g., move to different tab - maybe later).\n*   [x] **Feed Management (Frontend UI):**\n    *   [x] Add a \"+\" button or form to input a feed URL.\n    *   [x] Implement JS to call the `POST /api/feeds` endpoint.\n    *   [x] Add a \"close\" (X) button to each feed widget.\n    *   [x] Implement JS for the close button to call `DELETE /api/feeds/<feed_id>` and remove the widget from the DOM.\n*   [x] **Tab Management (Backend API):**\n    *   [x] `POST /api/tabs`: Create a new tab.\n    *   [x] `DELETE /api/tabs/<tab_id>`: Delete a tab (handle associated feeds - delete them or move to default?).\n    *   [x] `PUT /api/tabs/<tab_id>`: Rename a tab.\n*   [x] **Tab Management (Frontend UI):**\n    *   [x] Add UI elements for creating, deleting, and renaming tabs.\n    *   [x] Implement JS to interact with the corresponding API endpoints and update the UI.\n*   [x] **Dynamic Updates (Backend-driven):**\n    *   [x] The backend uses `APScheduler` to automatically fetch feed updates on a regular, configurable interval.\n    *   [x] The backend pushes notifications to connected clients using Server-Sent Events (SSE) when updates are complete.\n    *   [x] The frontend listens for SSE events and automatically refreshes the UI to display new content in near real-time.\n*   [x] Implement \"unread\" status (if desired):\n    *   [x] Add `is_read` flag to `FeedItems` model (default: false).\n    *   [x] Add API endpoint `POST /api/items/<item_id>/read` or similar.\n    *   [x] Update frontend to mark items visually and call the API (e.g., on click, or mark all visible as read).\n    *   [x] Update backend to calculate unread counts per feed/tab.\n    *   [x] Display unread counts in the UI (widgets, tabs).\n\n## Phase 4: Refinement, Persistence & Deployment\n\n*   [x] **Persistence:** Ensure the database file is stored in a persistent volume mapped into the Podman container. Update `Containerfile` accordingly.\n*   [x] **Error Handling:** Improve error handling on both backend (API responses) and frontend (network errors, parsing issues). Show user-friendly error messages.\n*   [x] **Configuration:** Allow basic configuration (e.g., feed update interval) via environment variables or a simple config file.\n*   [x] **Styling:** Refine CSS to better match the Netvibes look and feel. Make it reasonably responsive.\n*   [x] **Empty States:** Handle cases where a feed has no items or a tab has no feeds. Display informative messages.\n*   [x] **Optimization:**\n    *   [x] Optimize database queries.\n    *   [x] Implement backend caching (Redis) with granular invalidation.\n    *   [x] Minimize frontend re-renders.\n*   [x] **Documentation:**\n    *   [x] Write `README.md` covering setup instructions (building/running with Podman), configuration, and basic usage.\n    *   [x] Add comments to the code.\n*   [x] **Testing:**\n    *   [x] Add basic unit tests for backend logic (feed parsing, database interactions).\n    *   [x] Add basic unit tests for backend logic (API endpoints).\n    *   [ ] Consider basic end-to-end tests. (Deferred)\n*   [x] Finalize `Containerfile` for production readiness (non-root user, proper volume mounts, etc.).\n\n## Future Considerations\n\n*   [ ] Widget resizing/reordering (drag and drop).\n*   [ ] Import/Export OPML feed lists.\n*   [ ] Different widget view types (e.g., list vs. expanded).\n*   [ ] User authentication.\n*   [ ] Keyword filtering/highlighting within feeds.\n*   [ ] More advanced configuration options per feed.\n# AI Agents must respect the following rules\n\n## An Agent must always start by reading **all** `.md` files from the repository in order to have a global understanding of the application. They must also read both backend & frontend code files to understand the app's logic.\n\n## Agents' workflow :\n\n### During a single task, for each of its individual and intermediate step, an Agent must always:\n1. Add new relevant tests to the test suite.\n2. Verify that pre-existing tests are still valid, and correct them if necessary.\n3. Then, validate all tests by executing the full dedicated CI workflow as described in this document.\n4. Only then, start the next step.\n\n### Finishing a task :\n5. Before preparing to end a task it is necessary to run a last full validation of all tests.\n6. Then it is necessary to update all relevant .md files (*especially* `TODO.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`) accordingly.\n7. Only then will the task be completed, and changes be submitted / commited.\n\n## CI/CD and Automated Agent Execution Guide\n\nAutomated environments, such as those used by Google's Jules, operate in restricted settings where service ports may be mapped dynamically. The project's test suite is designed to handle this.\n\n**The most reliable reference is the project's own CI workflow, located at `.github/workflows/run-tests.yml`.** This file demonstrates exactly how to set up the environment and execute the tests. Agents should replicate this setup.\n\n### Key Configuration Points for Automated Agents:\n\n1.  **Service Containerization**: The tests require a running Redis service for caching checks. In the GitHub Actions workflow, this is accomplished using the `services` block to start a `redis:alpine` container. Your environment must provide a Redis container accessible to the test runner.\n\n2.  **Dynamic Port Handling**: In CI systems, you cannot assume Redis will be available on `localhost:6379`. The service container's port `6379` will be mapped to a *dynamic port* on the host runner. The GitHub Actions workflow retrieves this port using `${{ job.services.redis.ports['6379'] }}`.\n\n3.  **Environment Variable**: The test suite (`backend/test_app.py`) is explicitly configured to look for the `CACHE_REDIS_PORT` environment variable. If this variable is set, it will override the default Redis port and allow the tests to connect to the dynamically mapped port of the Redis service container.\n\n### Actionable Steps for Automated Agents:\n\nTo successfully run the backend tests, please follow this procedure, which mirrors our CI workflow:\n\n1.  **Start a Redis service container** within your environment, and **Identify the host port** that has been dynamically mapped to the container's internal port `6379`.\n2.  **Set the `CACHE_REDIS_PORT` environment variable** to this dynamically assigned port number.\n3.  Navigate to the `backend` directory, and **Install dependencies**: `cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt`.\n4.  **Run the tests** using the command: `python -m pytest -v`.\n\nBy following these instructions, which mirror the setup in our own CI workflow, automated tools should be able to execute the full test suite correctly. Always ensure it succeeds before submitting your changes.\n## Backend Testing\nThe backend of SheepVibes is written in Python and uses the `pytest` framework for testing.\n\n### I. Setup for Local Testing\n1.  Navigate to the backend directory. Install the necessary development dependencies within a Python virtual environment, including `pytest`:\n    ```bash\n    cd backend\n    python -m venv venv\n    source venv/bin/activate\n    pip install --upgrade pip\n    pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt\n    ```\n\n\n### II. Running Local Tests\nThe backend tests require a running Redis instance for caching checks.\n\n1.  **Start Redis**\n    Before running the tests, start a Redis container. The `--rm` flag will ensure it is automatically removed when stopped.\n    ```bash\n    # Using Podman\n    podman run -d --rm --name sheepvibes-test-redis -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine\n\n    # Or using Docker\n    # docker run -d --rm --name sheepvibes-test-redis -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine\n    ```\n\n2.  **Run Pytest**\n    Ensure you are in the `backend` directory with the virtual environment activated. The test suite is configured via `pytest.ini` to automatically connect to Redis on `localhost:6379`.\n    ```bash\n    # From the 'backend' directory\n    python -m pytest -v\n    ```\n\n3.  **Stop Redis**\n    After you've finished testing, you can stop the Redis container.\n    ```bash\n    podman stop sheepvibes-test-redis\n    ```\n\n## Frontend Testing\nCurrently, there are no automated tests specifically for the frontend JavaScript code.\n\n### Future Considerations\nFor a vanilla JavaScript application like this, End-to-End (E2E) testing would be a valuable addition. Suitable E2E testing tools include:\n\n* **Playwright:** [https://playwright.dev/](https://playwright.dev/)\n* **Cypress:** [https://www.cypress.io/](https://www.cypress.io/)\n\n## Automated Testing with GitHub Actions\nTo ensure code quality, the project uses a GitHub Actions workflow to run backend tests on every push and pull request. This workflow serves as the definitive guide for setting up an automated testing environment.\nThe workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/run-tests.yml`.\n\n## Recommendations for CI/CD and Automated Tools & Agents\nThe key is to follow the instructions given above, and replicate the setup found in our GitHub Actions workflow, paying close attention to the use of service containers and the `CACHE_REDIS_PORT` environment variable for dynamic port mapping.", "extras": {"command": "cat README.md CHANGELOG.md TODO.md AGENTS.md TESTING.md", "metadata": {"exit_code": 0, "pid": -1,
