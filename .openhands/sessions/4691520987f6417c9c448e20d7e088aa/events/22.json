Waits for code reviews from Google Code Assist and other agents\\n2. Addresses all review comments\\n3. Closes the current PR\\n4. Opens a new PR to trigger fresh reviews\\n\\n## Core Rules\\n\\n1. **Wait for reviews**: After creating a PR and marking it ready to review, wait 5 minutes for Google Code Assist and other agents to provide feedback\\n2. **Retry if no comments**: If no comments are received after 5 minutes, wait 5 more minutes and try one last time\\n3. **Address all comments**: Thoroughly review and implement all feedback from code reviews\\n4. **Close and reopen**: Close the current PR and open a new one to trigger fresh reviews\\n5. **Maximum 10 cycles**: Repeat the cycle for a maximum of 10 iterations\\n\\n## Workflow\\n\\n### Initial Setup:\\n1. Create a new branch with a meaningful name that describes the changes\\n2. Ensure the branch name is unique to avoid conflicts\\n\\n### Code Review Cycle (Repeat up to 10 times):\\n1. **Create PR**: Open a pull request with clear title and description\\n2. **Mark ready**: Immediately mark the PR as ready to review (not draft)\\n3. **Wait for reviews**: \\n   - Wait 5 minutes for Google Code Assist and other agents to provide feedback\\n   - If no comments received, wait 5 more minutes and check one last time\\n4. **Review comments**: Read and analyze all code review comments\\n5. **Address feedback**: Implement all requested changes and fixes\\n6. **Close PR**: Close the current pull request\\n7. **Push changes**: Push the latest changes to the branch\\n8. **Open new PR**: Create a new pull request to trigger fresh reviews\\n\\n## Implementation Guidelines\\n\\n### When Creating Pull Requests:\\n1. Use `create_pr` function with `draft: false`\\n2. Create meaningful branch names that describe the changes\\n3. Follow repository templates if they exist\\n4. Apply appropriate labels (e.g., \\\"enhancement\\\", \\\"bug\\\", \\\"documentation\\\")\\n3. Include clear descriptions of changes made and purpose\\n\\n### When Addressing Comments:\\n1. Read all comments thoroughly\\n2. Implement all requested changes\\n3. Verify tests pass after changes\\n4. Update documentation (CHANGELOG.md, TODO.md) as needed\\n\\n## Error Handling\\n\\n- **Authentication issues**: Update remote URL with current GITHUB_TOKEN\\n- **Branch conflicts**: Create new unique branch names\\n- **No comments received**: After waiting 10 minutes total, proceed to close and reopen\\n- **Maximum cycles reached**: Stop after 10 iterations and report completion\\n\\n## Usage Examples\\n\\n### Example Cycle:\\n1. Create branch: `feat/code-review-cycle-agent`\\n2. Open PR: \\\"feat: Add code review cycle microagent\\\"\\n3. Wait 5 minutes for reviews\\n4. If comments received, address them\\n5.
