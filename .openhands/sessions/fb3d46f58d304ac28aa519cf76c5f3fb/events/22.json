I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!\\n\\nThis pull request introduces the capability for users to modify existing feed URLs directly through the application's user interface. This enhancement streamlines feed management by providing an intuitive way to correct or update feed sources, with the system automatically refreshing feed details like name and site link upon a successful URL change. The implementation includes both backend API development for handling updates and frontend UI components for user interaction, alongside robust validation and testing.\\n\\n### Highlights\\n\\n* **Editable Feed URLs**: Users can now edit feed URLs directly from the UI. An edit button (\u270e) has been added to each feed widget, which opens a modal dialog for updating the URL.\\n* **Backend API for Feed Updates**: A new `PUT /api/feeds/<feed_id>` endpoint has been implemented to handle updating feed URLs. This endpoint includes validation to prevent duplicate URLs and automatically fetches the new feed's name and site link.\\n* **Frontend Modal and Validation**: An interactive modal dialog is provided for editing feed URLs, complete with client-side validation and error handling for a smoother user experience.\\n* **CORS Configuration**: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) support has been added to the backend, specifically configured for development environments to allow frontend and backend communication across different origins.\\n* **Development Port Update**: The backend development server now runs on port 5001 instead of 5000 to avoid potential conflicts.\\n* **Comprehensive Testing**: New unit and integration tests have been added for the feed URL update functionality, covering various scenarios including success, fetch failures, missing input, and duplicate URLs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary><b>Using Gemini Code Assist</b></summary>\\n<br>\\n\\nThe full guide for Gemini Code Assist can be found on our [documentation page](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/review-github-code), here are some quick tips.\\n\\n<b>Invoking Gemini</b>\\n\\nYou can request assistance from Gemini at any point by creating a comment using either `/gemini <command>` or `@gemini-code-assist <command>`.
