Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

Waits for code reviews from Google Code Assist and other agents\n2. Addresses all review comments\n3. Closes the current PR\n4. Opens a new PR to trigger fresh reviews\n\n## Core Rules\n\n1. **Wait for reviews**: After creating a PR and marking it ready to review, wait 5 minutes for Google Code Assist and other agents to provide feedback\n2. **Retry if no comments**: If no comments are received after 5 minutes, wait 5 more minutes and try one last time\n3. **Address all comments**: Thoroughly review and implement all feedback from code reviews\n4. **Close and reopen**: Close the current PR and open a new one to trigger fresh reviews\n5. **Maximum 10 cycles**: Repeat the cycle for a maximum of 10 iterations\n\n## Workflow\n\n### Initial Setup:\n1. Create a new branch with a meaningful name that describes the changes\n2. Ensure the branch name is unique to avoid conflicts\n\n### Code Review Cycle (Repeat up to 10 times):\n1. **Create PR**: Open a pull request with clear title and description\n2. **Mark ready**: Immediately mark the PR as ready to review (not draft)\n3. **Wait for reviews**: \n   - Wait 5 minutes for Google Code Assist and other agents to provide feedback\n   - If no comments received, wait 5 more minutes and check one last time\n4. **Review comments**: Read and analyze all code review comments\n5. **Address feedback**: Implement all requested changes and fixes\n6. **Commit changes**: Commit the fixes to the local branch\n7. **Close PR**: Close the current pull request\n8. **Push changes**: Push the latest changes to the branch\n9. **Open new PR**: Create a new pull request to trigger fresh reviews\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### When Creating Pull Requests:\n1. Use `create_pr` function with `draft: false`\n2. Create meaningful branch names that describe the changes\n3. Follow repository templates if they exist\n4. Apply appropriate labels (e.g., \"enhancement\", \"bug\", \"documentation\")\n5. Include clear descriptions of changes made and purpose\n\n### When Addressing Comments:\n1. Read all comments thoroughly\n2. Implement all requested changes\n3. Verify tests pass after changes\n4. Update documentation (CHANGELOG.md, TODO.md) as needed\n\n## Error Handling\n\n- **Authentication issues**: Update remote URL with current GITHUB_TOKEN\n- **Branch conflicts**: Create new unique branch names\n- **No comments received**: After waiting 10 minutes total, proceed to close and reopen\n- **Maximum cycles reached**: Stop after 10 iterations and report completion\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Example Cycle:\n1. Create branch: `feat/code-review-cycle-agent`\n2. Open PR: \"feat: Add code review cycle microagent\"\n3. Wait 5 minutes for reviews\n4. If comments received, address them\n5. Close current PR\n6. Push changes\n7. Open new PR with updated description\n\n## Configuration\n\n- Use environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` for authentication\n- Default base branch: `main`\n- Always verify PR creation was successful\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- This microagent complements the existing PR Ready to Review and SheepVibes Rules microagents\n- Follow all repository testing requirements and validation workflows, including running the full test suite before each PR creation.\n- Update relevant documentation files upon completion of each cycle\n\n# PR Ready to Review Microagent\n\nThis microagent provides guidance for ensuring that pull requests are immediately marked as \"ready to review\" after opening them.\n\n## Purpose\n\nEnsure that all pull requests created in the SheepVibes repository are immediately marked as ready for review, rather than being left as draft PRs.\n\n## Core Rules\n\n1. **Always mark PRs as ready to review** immediately after opening them\n2. **Never leave PRs in draft state** unless explicitly requested by the user\n3. **Apply appropriate labels** when creating PRs\n4. **Follow repository templates** if they exist\n\n## Workflow\n\n### When Creating a Pull Request:\n1. Set `draft: false` when using the `create_pr` function\n2. Include clear, descriptive titles and descriptions\n3. Reference any related issues or context\n4. Ensure code passes local checks and is ready for review before creating the PR\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n1. Use the GitHub API directly via `create_pr` function\n2. Set appropriate labels based on the changes (e.g., \"enhancement\", \"bug\", \"documentation\")\n3. Update relevant documentation files (CHANGELOG.md, TODO.md) as needed\n\n## Error Handling\n\n- If authentication fails, update remote URL with current GITHUB_TOKEN\n- If branch conflicts occur, create a new unique branch name\n- Always verify the PR was created successfully\n\n## Usage Examples\n\nWhen creating a PR for a new feature:\n- Title: \"feat: Add new widget functionality\"\n- Labels: \"enhancement\"\n- Description: Include purpose, changes made, and testing results\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- This microagent focuses on the PR creation process specifically\n- It complements the existing SheepVibes Rules microagent\n- Follow all existing repository rules and testing requirements\n\n## Configuration\n\n- Use environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` for authentication\n- Default base branch: `main`\n- Always create meaningful branch names that describe the changes\n\n# SheepVibes Repository Rules and Guidelines\n\nThis microagent provides comprehensive knowledge about the SheepVibes RSS/Atom feed aggregator repository, including development workflows, testing requirements, and deployment procedures.\n\n## Core Rules for AI Agents\n\n### Mandatory Workflow Steps\n1. **Read all `.md` files** from the repository before starting any task\n2. **Read both backend & frontend code files** to understand the application's logic\n3. **For each individual step** during a task:\n   - Add new relevant tests to the test suite\n   - Verify pre-existing tests are still valid, correct if necessary\n4. **Execute full CI workflow** as described in `.github/workflows/run-tests.yml`\n5. **Before task completion**:\n   - Run final full validation of all tests\n   - Update relevant `.md` files (especially `TODO.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`)\n\n### Testing Requirements\n- **Backend tests** require a running Redis service container\n- **Dynamic port handling** - Redis port is dynamically mapped in CI environments\n- **Environment variable**: Tests look for `CACHE_REDIS_PORT` to override default Redis port\n- **Full test suite execution** is mandatory before proceeding to next steps\n\n## Application Architecture\n\n### Backend (Python/Flask)\n- **Framework**: Flask with SQLAlchemy ORM\n- **Database**: SQLite with migrations\n- **Caching**: Redis for performance optimization\n- **Background tasks**: APScheduler for automatic feed updates\n- **API**: RESTful endpoints for tabs, feeds, and feed items\n\n### Frontend (Vanilla JavaScript)\n- **No frameworks** - pure JavaScript, HTML, CSS\n- **Real-time updates**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live feed updates\n- **UI**: Netvibes/iGoogle-inspired grid layout\n\n## Development Environment Setup\n\n### Production Deployment (Podman Pod with systemd/Quadlet)\n- Use `scripts/deploy_pod.sh` for stable deployment\n- Pod includes: app container, Redis container, persistent volumes\n- Auto-start configured via systemd user services\n\n### Local Development Options\n1. **Podman containers** with development network\n2. **Direct backend/frontend** development with virtual environment\n\n## Key Configuration Variables\n- `DATABASE_PATH`: SQLite database file location\n- `UPDATE_INTERVAL_MINUTES`: Feed update frequency (default: 15)\n- `CACHE_REDIS_URL`: Redis connection URL\n\n## Testing Procedures\n\n### Backend Testing\n1. Start Redis container: `podman run -d --rm --name sheepvibes-test-redis -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine`\n2.

Description\\r\\n\\r\\nThis PR adds the ability to edit feed URLs directly from the UI. Users can now click the edit button (\u270e) on any feed widget to update the feed URL, which automatically updates the feed name and site link.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n### Backend\\r\\n- Added `PUT /api/feeds/<feed_id>` endpoint for updating feed URLs and properties\\r\\n- Implemented validation to prevent duplicate feed URLs\\r\\n- Added CORS configuration for development\\r\\n- Updated port configuration to 5001 for development\\r\\n\\r\\n### Frontend\\r\\n- Added edit button to each feed widget\\r\\n- Implemented modal dialog for editing feed URLs\\r\\n- Added comprehensive error handling and validation\\r\\n\\r\\n### Testing\\r\\n- Added comprehensive tests for the new functionality\\r\\n- All existing tests continue to pass\\r\\n\\r\\n## Testing Notes\\r\\n- Backend tests require a running Redis service container\\r\\n- Dynamic port handling for Redis in CI environments\\r\\n- Environment variable `CACHE_REDIS_PORT` can override default Redis port\\r\\n\\r\\n## Deployment\\r\\n- Updated configuration for development environment\\r\\n- Maintains compatibility with existing production deployment\\r\\n\\r\\nThis feature allows users to easily update feed URLs when they change or need correction.\",\n  \"created_at\": \"2025-10-07T00:00:17Z\",\n  \"updated_at\": \"2025-10-07T00:00:38Z\",\n  \"closed_at\": null,\n  \"merged_at\": null,\n

I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!\\n\\nThis pull request introduces the capability for users to modify existing feed URLs directly through the application's user interface. This enhancement streamlines feed management by providing an intuitive way to correct or update feed sources, with the system automatically refreshing feed details like name and site link upon a successful URL change. The implementation includes both backend API development for handling updates and frontend UI components for user interaction, alongside robust validation and testing.\\n\\n### Highlights\\n\\n* **Editable Feed URLs**: Users can now edit feed URLs directly from the UI. An edit button (\u270e) has been added to each feed widget, which opens a modal dialog for updating the URL.\\n* **Backend API for Feed Updates**: A new `PUT /api/feeds/<feed_id>` endpoint has been implemented to handle updating feed URLs. This endpoint includes validation to prevent duplicate URLs and automatically fetches the new feed's name and site link.\\n* **Frontend Modal and Validation**: An interactive modal dialog is provided for editing feed URLs, complete with client-side validation and error handling for a smoother user experience.\\n* **CORS Configuration**: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) support has been added to the backend, specifically configured for development environments to allow frontend and backend communication across different origins.\\n* **Development Port Update**: The backend development server now runs on port 5001 instead of 5000 to avoid potential conflicts.\\n* **Comprehensive Testing**: New unit and integration tests have been added for the feed URL update functionality, covering various scenarios including success, fetch failures, missing input, and duplicate URLs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary><b>Using Gemini Code Assist</b></summary>\\n<br>\\n\\nThe full guide for Gemini Code Assist can be found on our [documentation page](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/review-github-code), here are some quick tips.\\n\\n<b>Invoking Gemini</b>\\n\\nYou can request assistance from Gemini at any point by creating a comment using either `/gemini <command>` or `@gemini-code-assist <command>`.

Code Review\\n\\nThis pull request introduces a valuable feature for editing feed URLs, complete with a backend API, frontend modal, and comprehensive tests. The implementation is well-structured. My review focuses on a performance optimization in the backend to avoid a redundant network call, improving the frontend's API configuration to be more robust for production environments, and enhancing the user experience by displaying submission errors directly in the edit modal.\",\n    \"state\": \"COMMENTED\",\n    \"html_url\": \"https://github.com/sheepdestroyer/SheepVibes/pull/100#pullrequestreview-3307885173\",\n    \"pull_request_url\": \"https://api.github.com/repos/sheepdestroyer/SheepVibes/pulls/100\",\n    \"author_association\": \"CONTRIBUTOR\",\n    \"_links\": {\n      \"html\": {\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/sheepdestroyer/SheepVibes/pull/100#pullrequestreview-3307885173\"\n      },\n      \"pull_request\": {\n        \"href\": \"https://api.github.com/repos/sheepdestroyer/SheepVibes/pulls/100\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"submitted_at\": \"2025-10-07T00:02:30Z\",\n    \"commit_id\": \"8fdd364921fa2441be42f6a9b58db4c578fbae99\"\n  }\n]", "extras": {"command": "curl -H \"Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN\" https://api.github.com/repos/sheepdestroyer/SheepVibes/pulls/100/reviews", "metadata": {"exit_code": 0, "pid": -1, "username": "root", "hostname": "cd981820443f", "working_dir": "/workspace/SheepVibes", "py_interpreter_path": "/openhands/micromamba/envs/openhands/bin/python", "prefix": "", "suffix": "\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]"}, "hidden": false}, "success": true}]
