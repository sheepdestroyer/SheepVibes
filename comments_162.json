I've reviewed the new documentation and the main shell script, `check-review-status.sh`. The documentation has some inconsistencies regarding the polling mechanism's timing that should be clarified. The script is well-structured but has a critical bug in its exit logic that could lead to incorrect status reporting, along with some opportunities for simplification and clarification, such as removing a redundant API call and explaining some magic numbers. My detailed comments and suggestions are below.",

    "body": "## Code Review\n\nThis PR introduces a unified microagent and tools for tracking PR reviews, which is a great simplification. The new documentation and scripts are well-structured. My review focuses on a few areas for improvement:\n- **Documentation Clarity**: There are some inconsistencies in the `pr-review-tracker.md` file regarding polling times and script exit codes.\n- **Script Correctness**: I found a critical bug in `check-review-status.sh` where an `exit` command within a subshell does not terminate the script as intended, leading to incorrect behavior.\n- **Script Efficiency and Maintainability**: There are opportunities to improve the script by removing a redundant API call and documenting a magic number to make the code more efficient and easier to maintain.\n\nOverall, these are solid additions. Addressing these points will improve the robustness and clarity of the new tooling.",
